His journey hasn't been easy. Returning to a world that moved on without him, Andrew faced the weight of lost timestrained relationships, outdated skills, and the stigma that follows an incarceration record. Rebuilding trust with loved ones took patience. Adapting to rapid technological advancements meant relearning even the simplest daily tasks. Through it all, Andrew found strength in the very thing he advocates forcommunity. By surrounding himself with mentors, like-minded peers, and people who believed in his growth, he was able to navigate these challenges step by step. As he shares, \"What will turn an ex-offender away from prison is when he or she has communities of support that they can count on. When people feel seen, valued, and supported, they are more likely to thrive.\" YellowRibbonProject SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances ASecondChanceToMyself"

Give yourself a chance, surrender everything and gain acceptance.\"BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances YellowRibbonProject YRP20"

In May this year, a group of partner employers from the logistics industry came together to attend a 1.5-day workshop on 'Master Workplace Coaching and Mentoring' conducted by NTUC Learning Hub. YRSG's career coaches and trainers from The Logistics Academy facilitated group discussions on overcoming challenges at work. We appreciate the continuous efforts that our partner employers put into providing second chances for ex-offenders and look forward to bringing more on board to join us on this journey.

Throughout the years, YRF has provided financial assistance for low-income ex-offenders who wish to pursue further education or acquire vocational skills after their release through various programmes, helping over 70,000 beneficiaries, including Mohammad Ridzwan Bin Abdol Latiff. As a recipient of the YRF STAR Bursary, he shares with us why events like these inspire him in his journey to restart his life.

Today, we're excited to share the story of Ellyana Bte Ramlee, on her journey as a mother and in particular, how she overcame challenges while serving time in prison. Ellyana shared how becoming a mother at a young age motivated her to work hard and provide the best for her son. \"I wanted to carry all the responsibilities on my own,\" she said. However, serving time in prison was a difficult time for Ellyana and her family, especially when it came to being separated from her son. \"It was heartbreaking to lie to my son about my whereabouts,\" she shared. Rebuilding her relationship with her son after her release was another obstacle for Ellyana. \"I had a lot of fears and doubts about myself,\" she shared. \"I didn't want him to be overwhelmed by my presence after being away for quite some time.\" Balancing motherhood and work can be challenging, but Ellyana tries to make the best of her off days, planning fun activities with her son. The most important lesson Ellyana hopes to pass on to her children is that \"it's okay to seek help if you need to. Nothing to be embarrassed about and it will not make you look weak.\" Ellyana's experience as a mother has also influenced her work with other ex-offenders and their families. \"I hope that my stories have educated them better and that they can seek treatment for their children from the different organisations that offer help,\" she said. For Mother's Day this year, Ellyana is celebrating with her family at home as it coincides with her son's 15th birthday. Thank you, Ellyana, for sharing your inspiring story with us!

Recently, Singapore's women's tchoukball team made history by becoming world champion, and she couldn't be prouder of her team's achievement. \"Getting champion for last year's Asia games led us to be world No. 1, but there was also a lot of hard work put in by all the other ex-national women players who helped us get there,\" she shared.When asked about the most important message she wants to send to young women thinking of pursuing sports in a male-dominated environment, Li Qing responded simply, \"Go for it!\" We love Li Qing's passion for sports and commitment to her job and tchoukball, and we hope her story can inspire more young women to persevere and pursue their passions!

We got married in 2019. She re-located to Singapore in 2021 and we are finally living together after almost four years of long-distance relationship. It was difficult but we persevered and overcame the distance and difficulties.One of their fondest memories would be the time when they were walking along the streets of Hong Kong in the middle of the night. There was a light drizzle and as they neared Elsa's home, Chris stopped in the middle of the empty road, held up both her hands, looked into her eyes and asked her to be his girlfriend, to which she agreed! Chris goes on to describe how Elsa supported him, \"Many ex-offenders come out from prison broken, wounded, and doubtful of acceptance, but for me, Elsa's love and support were paramount in encouraging me, and guiding me through acceptance and validation.\"An integral member of their family, Big Nose has been with Chris for 10 years! The soft toy was a source of comfort for Elsa, who formed a strong attachment to it during Chris incarceration. Big Nose was with her throughout that time, and I believe that he is to her a personification of me. Now that all three of us are together, she would sometimes lament that I am spending more time with him than her!\" With a shared love of travelling and enjoying new experiences, Chris and Elsas story is a testament to the power of redemption, second chances, and the resilience of the human spirit. We hope that it inspires others to believe in the power of love and the possibility of a brighter future, no matter what their past may hold.Happy Valentine's Day!SG4SecondChances HappyValentinesDay"

With the Yellow Ribbon Community Arts Festival (YR CAF) 2022, many inmate artists have a platform to share their talents and artwork in public. Lets find out more about Dr Lows experience in mentoring the inmates! ?It has been a great experience working with the inmates, especially in understanding their ideas and what they wish to achieve. All of the inmates talked about their families and wanted to express the meaning of their relationships with their loved ones through their artworks. Despite challenges, the inmates did their best to work with what they had and completed their artworks in their own unique way. ?There was one inmate who was afraid to paint anything bigger than A6 paper at the start. It took her about four weeks to finally have the confidence to paint on a larger piece of A1 paper, and she was able to do so independently. I was very proud that she was able to overcome her fears and was able to motivate herself to try something new towards a successful end.------ Enjoy meaningful artwork, beautiful poetry, baked treats, and live music performances over the weekend by supervisees and ex-offenders, at the YR CAF 2022, happening from 5 to 13 November 2022! Organised in collaboration with and , YR CAF 2022 is a one-of-a-kind experience that showcases creative expressions, allowing inmates and ex-offenders to convey their desires to change for a better future, for themselves and their families.

However, unlike classes conducted in public, classes conducted inside prisons could still be easily affected by the pandemic in view of the dense environment in prisons. It was definitely a challenge for our team, but with careful planning, we ensured that our beneficiaries were still able to receive the help and training needed in a safe environment.\"Hareez feels proud that his work at Yellow Ribbon Singapore expands the ex-offenders' employability skills, giving them a better chance at being employed and facilitating reintegration into society.

It was a pivotal moment for me as I believed it ignited my passion for cooking. In a way, my late brother has planted this passion for cooking in me, right until now. Thus, this dish is my tribute to him. When asked if he was confident of winning the competition, he shared that he would try his best, but emphasised that his main reason for joining the competition was to try something new and enjoy the process.

The Pan Pacific Hotels Group has been a strong advocate of inclusive employment from across diverse backgrounds and communities, and these efforts have created a more compassionate working environment for our workforce. Im glad that at our hotel, this compassion has extended to supporting ex-offenders in their reintegration into society. With an avid commitment to providing employment and skills training to ex-offenders, Mr Ho shares with us, For ex-offenders, we should continue to be their advocates by sharing success stories of rehabilitation, career progression and their assimilation back to society. As a business, we must also continue to extend support to them and listen to them, just as we would for any other associate on our team. This helps us to understand their situation, needs and in managing expectations. We will then be able to support the ex-offenders in their reintegration journey and help them to achieve their goals.YRConnects SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

Her volunteering journey began in 2021, when she was inspired to do more for second chances after a surreal vision of a divine guide showed her a sign of unravelling yarn. This sparked her desire to help inmates and ex-offenders. At 22, Yen Ee and her team from are dedicated to her volunteer work with Yellow Ribbon Project that spans from teaching other volunteers how to crochet, as well as guiding over 50 inmates and ex-offenders to learn the craft. She also pioneered the Yellow Ribbon crochet pattern, which can be viewed here: \"It is good to know that I taught someone a skill, so that they might feel proud of themselves for creating something out of nothing,\", Yen Ee shared, hoping to provide support to help inmates cope. There are a lot of people out there who need help and this project helps to open that door to giving them an outlet to cope and perhaps even use this craft to start their own ventures in the future, and I would appeal to the youth to use their unique talents and crafts to volunteer as well, as having volunteers ready to help is a huge step in rehabilitation and reintegration for many.

Incarcerated for drug-related offences, Ridwans enthusiasm for music never waned. I started playing the guitar in primary school. However, I picked up playing the keyboard five years ago, while in the prison. It was during my incarceration that I managed to attain the Basic Music Class Grade 5 as well. The Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen fan shares that his passion for music has motivated him to stay clean, and with his loved ones support for his musical inclinations, he has been able to free his mind from stress.

This was the reintegration experience for Grace, a Customer Service Team Leader at XDel Singapore Pte Ltd. I was imprisoned for drug offences for almost six years and because of that, I could not take care of my family. While serving my sentence, I reflected and decided to turn over a new leaf, so I resumed my education while in prison. I was eventually selected for the Community-based Programme and placed in a halfway house. Worried about her past affecting her career options, Grace was ecstatic to find XDel Singapore assessing her purely based on her own merits. They made me feel very comfortable and offered me the opportunity to work for them. Today, Grace credits XDel for turning her life around. For Grace, employment support went a long way in stabilising and anchoring her reintegration journey. Thank you XDel for believing in second chances, and giving Grace self-confidence, a sense of purpose and the opportunity to successfully reintegrate into society.

I began with marijuana at the age of 13, and this led me to heroin addiction at the age of 15. Being dependent on these drugs, I also ended up in the company of gangs and I was arrested for the first time at the age of 22.For the well-known Triad Trails, Bruce, a charismatic tour leader, shared the historical secrets that Singapores Central Business District conceals. It gives ex-offenders like me, an opportunity to have conversations that otherwise would not be possible, as it gives our tourists the liberty to ask us about our past without hesitation.As an advocate for youths-at-risk, Bruce dedicates his time to give talks at schools, and train to be a street journalist. He also spends quality time with his family. He highlighted that people are sometimes judgmental and slow to trust those with criminal pasts. Thus, he wants to help ex-offenders have a good support system when they are released to reduce their chances of re-offending.A believer in faith, he shared that change often comes from within. Many ex-offenders and their families approach me for help and support after their release from prisons, and I truly feel that unless there is an innate desire for change within a person, its difficult to bring about a large-scale change to society. But I would like to tell our society and community to take a chance on us, as those of us who are serious about changing our lives are some of the most hardworking and sincere people you will meet.SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

I have been a Toastmasters Prison Volunteer for over 15 years and often take the opportunity to support the Yellow Ribbon activities whenever I can.\" Keeping healthy became a priority for Mr Yeow, an adjunct lecturer at Nanyang Polytechnic, after he discovered that physiotherapy and regular exercise help him with knee pain five years ago. In his mission to stay active, he persevered and has been an ardent supporter of the Yellow Ribbon cause. During this COVID-19 period, the YRVR allowed me to enjoy the outdoors, walking around the neighbourhood and beyond to discover new sights and surprising things that I was not aware of before. He also shared that some of his favourite walking spots are around Bedok Park Connector, where he takes in the sights of nature, as well as creative murals and art pieces along the way. Mr Yeow hopes to encourage others to be involved in rehabilitation efforts. In doing so, we will develop empathy for inmates and ex-offenders, and at the same time, help them unlock their second prisons. YRVR2021 YRInspire2021 ChallengeYRself SG4SecondChances"

Erics passion for supporting ex-offenders in their rehabilitation and reintegration goes back to 1968, when he, then 17-year-old, played guitar at Changi Prison for Prison Chapel Services. Over the years, he opted to become a prison counsellor and has continued his legacy of helping inmates for the past 54 years. .The first time my dad invited me to join him in the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run was 5 years ago, for a 10km run. The finishing point was at the prison compound itself. It was astonishing and admirable. I felt a deep connection because of my Dad. I understood the meaning of the years of his dedication to the cause and that somehow sparked my interest in the Yellow Ribbon cause too. .Running with dad is like running with a man with a legacy in volunteer work who does not quit. That, I feel, is my fondest memory for this years run. During our runs, he would share wonderful stories with me of many inmates who have mended their ways and done well for themselves after their incarceration.

What I realise is that every jail sentence meted out to punish the wrongdoing of a person must serve a social purpose. The society must be compassionate and help to rehabilitate those who were jailed to return to the society and to be good citizens. The society must help to mitigate the suffering of innocent members of the family, especially the children. We must help to support their daily needs, provide them the education and training to help them to reintegrate into society.

Ex-offenders are no different from you and me, all striving to build a better tomorrow. Look beyond the past, treasure the present, create a bright future. Lucas Lam, Singapore Media AcademyAs a first-time participant for this years inaugural Yellow Ribbon Virtual Run, Singapore Media Academys (SMA) Lucas Lam hopes that this event will raise awareness to the cause of the Yellow Ribbon Project, and encourage employers to hire ex-offenders. Mr Lam describes how SMAs diploma enriches the lives of inmates and provides them with the right tools that aid their reintegration process after release. He shared, We partnered YRSG to kick off the inaugural batches for two diploma programmes to selected inmates in November 2020. The main objectives of both programmes is to arm the inmates with industry relevant skills with hands-on training to be able to join the workforce.Join us and support second chances - link in bio!YRVR2021 YRInspire2021 ChallengeYRself SG4SecondChances"

Now eight years on, he shares the highlights of his role as a Senior Skills Associate. .As a Senior Skills Associate, I assist ex-offenders with skills training in the community after their release. We conduct briefings, and also coach them to deepen their skills, which improves their chances of employment. The type of training we run is accredited by Singapore to ensure that they are equipped with industry relevant skills, such as Culinary Arts, Generic Manufacturing and Design Thinking. ?The pleasant moment when I bump into ex-offenders outside, and they would thank me for supporting them. Im happy to see many of them still doing well and going strong after their release, knowing that the training they went through had a life-changing impact on their reintegration journey. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If you are looking for a fulfilling career and have the heart to help others change for the better, do visit to join us.

For the next few weeks, we would talk constantly, and he slowly regained his confidence and determination to overcome his challenges.

He remains determined to stay on the right path and provide for his family. He is also an active volunteer with Industrial and Services Co-operative Society Limited (ISCOS), where he speaks to inmates through outreach programmes in prisons.Looking back, Ramachandran recalled that his arrest had changed things for his family. In his absence, his wife juggled between her job and taking care of their three children. While in prison, Ramachandran felt a sense of loss to be away from his family and guilty that he had missed out on their milestones and birthdays. Family support, Ramachandran says, was the driving force that kept him going. It motivated him to stay positive and eventually pushed him to turn his life around for good.I hope to be a living testament for those who feel like they have no guidance, those who feel hopeless or even someone who needs a listening ear.

So she chased for validation and attention in the hope to attain fulfilment.This led her down a rabbit hole of constant partying and drugs. Even after her imprisonment in 2002 for drug related offences, Hannah continued taking drugs after her release.All that changed when Hannah had her son. He reminded her of the struggles she had while growing up, and motivated her to change for the better to provide a better life for him. I didnt want him to grow up like how I did, and I didnt want to affect him with the state I was in, said Hannah. Today, Hannah is a proud mother of four and spends her time volunteering at The Turning Point, a womens halfway house which provides structured aftercare support for offenders. She also leads a team of volunteers to counsel individuals who need guidance.It has been 16 years since Hannahs last release from prisons, and she hopes to carry the lessons from her past to inspire others to lead better life. My past gave me an opportunity to share how dust can turn into diamonds. Ex-offenders are walking through a journey which has many steps behind an average human being. So let's all be kind and have patience. The more love they receive, the more they are strengthened and motivated from within. When you show kindness to them, you may not know that you are contributing to their healing.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

It has been a difficult period for the inmates as open visits with their families could not be organized due to COVID-19 safety management measures. The day started with a demonstration by Chef Aishah from SSA Culinary Institute, followed by a hands-on session for the inmates. Their labour of love was also freshly delivered with the help of Bravehearts SRM Services Pte Ltd to convey their love for their families.It was great to see them so involved and curious. They wanted to learn more and asked many questions about the baking process. Seeing their interest makes me heartened to offer more of my knowledge. said Chef Aishah.Thank you to .institute and for partnering with Yellow Ribbon Project (YRP) and making this possible for our inmates and their families.

For Hanz, her grandfathers brush with death changed her perspective on life and encouraged her to quit her life of crime. Back then, I was living a life without goals and discipline. I was around addicts, those selling illegal cigarettes and many others. My day only started when others ended theirs. I would sleep in the morning, and once the sun goes down thats when my day would start.During a family visit while she was still incarcerated, Hanzs parents shared that her grandfather had suffered from a heart attack, and in his moments of consciousness, called out for Hanz to come to him. That was a blow. I panicked and asked if he was ok. They said yes but said that he was still calling for me. That really motivated me to stay clean and finish my sentence. The fear of losing a loved one while being inside... its something you will regret, said Hanz.With the support of her family, Hanz has stayed crime free for the past 10 years. Now 32, Hanz is a manager at a popular retail store and is looking forward to owning her first home.After all the support and hard work, Ive finally managed to get my own house. Im waiting to collect my keys now. Im thankful to my bosses and general manager who have always believed in me and trusted me, Hanz shared with gratitude.We are all the same, though the path we choose might be different. Everyone makes mistakes, and they just need that opportunity to change. The support we receive will help in our journey of finding our way home.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

I also wanted him to be more financially stable, so I got him a job as a Grab driver. But I told him that he needs to help himself too. I even asked him Do you want to change your habits or change your address to Changi Prison?Things took a turn when their father suffered a stroke during Yusufs third incarceration. This was a wake-up call for him, as he came to the realization that he could lose his father while being incarcerated. With Farahs help and coordination, Yusuf was able to speak to his father again.During the pandemic, we made phone calls instead of tele-visits. Otherwise my dad would not have been well enough to leave the house. In the call, Yusuf told our dad that he would pray for him and hopefully be able to see him again soon. My dad was very happy to hear this as he had been asking about Yusuf, said Farah.Yusuf is thankful for the support he has received and plans to join his family in the construction industry after his release in 2021.The support from Yusufs sister will be one of the critical factors for his successful reintegration.

But I knew I would never see my mom again. I told my friends, Dont bail me out. I will just go. said Gary.Gary was first imprisoned in 2000 for drug possession. He shared that it was through friends that he came to know about drugs. He relapsed in 2004, and served an additional three years behind bars. During his second imprisonment, he shared that the opportunities that he received then that kick-started his culinary journey.Prisons gave me a lot of chances to excel. I had the chance to head Dining Behind Bars (DBB), and they allowed me to select and lead the whole team. I was the very first executive chef for DBB and was glad to pull through many events with exciting menus. Through all the events, I managed to upgrade myself.But it wasnt until his third imprisonment that Gary decided to quit his old lifestyle for good. I was married before my last imprisonment and was doing well in life. But my biggest mistake was when I started to get close to drugs again. This was when my moms cancer relapsed.Today, Gary is the successful owner of several culinary and consultancy businesses. He is grateful for the help he received during his imprisonment and seeks to give back by hiring ex-offenders for his own company. When inmates are released from prisons, they really try their best. But they get hindered by so many setbacks, it brings their patience and confidence down. The unlocking of the second prison plays a big part and I hope that families do their best to support them. Else it would be difficult (for their rehabilitation). said Gary.And to other inmates, when you are released, you need to have a goal. Whether its long or short term, big or small goals it doesnt matter. If you dont have a goal, you will find that your life is pointless. You may do things that could eventually hurt your family.

Its unnecessary to keep them, added Daniel.When asked about their motivations, the trio shared that it was their families that kept them going.My children grew up without me, and my wife survived without me. I want to be a good husband and father as theyve sacrificed a lot for me. Its time for me to give back to them, said Daniel.Ive disappointed my parents seven times, but they are still supportive and believe in my change. Their belief motivates me to change, shared Farhan.As Adam, Farhan and Daniel look forward to their future, they hope for a permanent and stable return to make amends for their past mistakes.We also want to be part of society and the community, and be as happy as everyone (else). Nobody sets out in their life to make a mistake and go to prison. said Adam.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

The movement aims to restore nature back into our garden city through the planting of more than a million trees with more than 163,000 trees planted to date!Residents from both halfway houses started the day with a collective beach clean-up at Sembawang Park, followed by prep work for the tree planting. We are happy to share that residents planted a total of 30 trees during the initiative! Thank you for giving the residents from the halfway houses the opportunities to give back to help build a greener nation for future generations to enjoy. This project was also made possible through the coordination with Ms Nutan Shah, a participant from the Emerging Stronger Conversation Beyond Second Chances event held in 2020. She had approached the organisers with the intention to bring ex-offenders and the community closer through nature. SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

From engaging ex-offenders to understanding their needs, as well as on-site job visits and check-ins with their employers, being a career coach is challenging but a rewarding and meaningful job!In celebration of the International Womens Day this year, we speak to Julie Watt, who is one of the 13 career coaches at the Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG), to find out more about her passions and role as a career coach.While studying Criminology, Julie learnt that people are driven by certain factors (social, environmental or personal choice) to commit crimes. On a more personal level, she also felt compelled to help the needy like inmates and ex-offenders, and wanted a hands-on career that allows her to pursue her passion to help. With these ambitions in mind, she accepted a job as a career coach at YRSG.My favorite part of the job is when I am able to go on-site and engage the supervisees to understand their situations in a more in-depth manner. Understanding their stories allows me to build rapport with them. They also become more comfortable and I gain their confidence and trust that YRSG is able to make a difference in their lives. Being in this field also poses its own set of challenges, such as management and prioritization of supervisees needs. However, Julie is grateful to her reporting officer, Siti Aishah, for her guidance through the different cases, and has also learnt to organize and plan her work week to better manage her time.But on her most hectic days, it is the outcome of making a positive difference in the lives of others that keeps her going.I had an ex-offender whom I managed previously. She shared that she was grateful to have me as her career coach. The ex-offender said she appreciated the way I encouraged and motivated her. That made her want to work towards being a better version of herself. To Julie Watt and other women who are passionate about making a positive difference in the lives of others, we celebrate your achievements in helping to create an inclusive world!BeyondSecondChances CelebratingSGWomen ChooseToChallenge"

However, I have also seen the unspoken impact it has on some of them through their expressions and that for me hits home on the work we need to continue doing to bridge the gap.Additionally, through the support of my fellow committee members who each are experts in their own fields, all this has inspired me to continue volunteering for YRF.Despite disruptions during the COVID-19 period, YRF continues to offer support to beneficiaries in need of help. More than $400,000 has been set aside by YRF to support ex-offenders, families and children of the incarcerated for initiatives such as the Yellow Ribbon Emergency Fund (YREF), YRF-Residential Aftercare Support Programme (RASP) and CARE Packs for Families of Incarcerated.If you require assistance from YRF, please reach out to cheryl_poon.gov.sg."

For Kasmawati, she was the sole caregiver and parental figure to her son when she was released in 2013. She juggled between jobs, housing loans and supporting her son - often dealing with her problems alone. She was not always optimistic about her situation but shared that it was her family and community who helped pull her through rough times.I aim to be a better person for my family. They constantly remind me not to go back to my old ways. My community and neighbours are helpful too they always give me encouragement.Kasmawati also credits her progress to her counsellor, Janet. She had received counselling from the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) for six months after her release, but continued after as it had helped her tremendously.Janet was very helpful. When I was released, she always called me to check up on me and showed me where to ask for help. I realised that if people want to help me, I should also help myself.Today, Kasmawati is a therapist to stroke patients at SynPhNe Pte Ltd and is also involved in rehabilitative and community work. She is the project chairwoman for various community projects and continues to take up volunteer work in her free time.When asked what advice she would share with other ex-offenders who might be struggling, Kasmawati said, Dont lose hope.

With safe management measures in place, we had to adapt to a new normal in order to continue supporting our offenders who are preparing to reintegrate back into society. Before COVID-19, employers used to conduct face-to-face interview sessions with inmates. However, due to the pandemic, these interview sessions have since been conducted virtually. Mr Evan Ng, senior executive of talent acquisition at RE&S Enterprises Pte Ltd, a regional food service company, had recently participated in a virtual interview with several inmates at Changi Prison Complex. He said, \"In the span of an hour, I managed to interview seven inmates virtually and I found some of them suitable for the vacancies in my company. \"With the introduction of virtual interviews, it is more convenient for me to find suitable candidates for my vacant positions. I could ask them questions about themselves and gauge their reactions and responses from the video interview to ascertain suitability.\"If youre interested in working with us to employ ex-offenders, visit to find out more.BeyondSecondChances"

It was a bit troublesome to adapt to the virtual sessions at first, as I didnt understand how to use the tablet, said Daniels father Haikal (pseudonym), but we eventually got used to it. The e-tuition has also proven to be beneficial to Daniel, who was lagging behind in his studies before he started his lessons.

Acceptance from the community for ex-offenders will pave the way for them to better reintegrate into society and prevent them from going back to their old ways.

You may or may not make a new friend, if not you would have at least lent them a listening ear.Last but not least, we asked Farisha about her favourite running quote and she added: \"It's all in the mind.

After they pass the work trial, they are just like a regular full-timer. The only difference is they have a job coach to guide them along the way. Other than that, they are no different than any other regular employee and are treated equally. It all boils down to the performance and their attitude towards the job. Mr Chia shared that with the six-month pilot Career Trial (CT) programme, employers will get an avenue to access the ex-offenders suitability for the job before offering them a permanent employment.Ex-offenders are also offered on the Job Training (OJT) to ensure that they have the correct skillset for their job. This programme helps to strengthen employment outcomes through a short-term work stint with employers, and help ex-offenders navigate challenges after a long period of displacement from work.Once the employability of an ex-offender is enhanced, they will have an easier time reintegrating into society.

While repairing broken pipes and fixing clogged toilets, a girl named Mei caught his eye, however he was too shy to approach her. He spent the next few months calling 50 different telephone numbers written across his trousers to look for Mei, which he eventually found after much difficulty, and started courting her. After 10 years of dating, they got married in 1997.However things soured in 2007 when Mei caught him red-handed consuming drugs at home. That was when she decided to take their sons and leave him for good. In 2008, with the intention of starting anew, he checked himself into a halfway house. It was only during his third stint in that halfway house that he turned over a new leaf. During the three years at the halfway house, he found religion, companionship and eventually went on to become an employee at the halfway house. By 2014, he felt empowered enough to leave the halfway house and devoted his Saturdays with Mei and his boys. His Sundays were reserved for church and volunteering with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, where Alvin conducts faith-based counselling programmes in prison.As time went on, Alvin and Mei realized that their feelings for each other had never faded. Alvin proposed to Mei again in 2016, and they remarried within the same year. Here at the Yellow Ribbon Project, we couldn't be happier to celebrate stories of SecondChances.

He credits his rehabilitation to his family for walking with him and spoke about how his sister went the extra mile to get him a new phone and got him to discard all of his old contacts.Through the support and assistance rendered by Yellow Ribbon Community Project (YRCP) volunteers, Adam was then able to find his footing and turn his life around. He decided to give back to society by becoming a YRCP volunteer himself since \"if they (public) can give me a chance, why not i support them (ex-offenders) as well?\" One memorable case he remembered was when he helped a mother and two children while the father was in prison. As a father of two kids himself, he felt the need to help them. Now, he shares that he still visits the family every two weeks to check in on how they are doing. When asked why such volunteers are important, Adam shared that family and community support is key to reaching out to ex-offenders. He also shared that when he sometimes reveals his background to the families he helps, they are very surprised and ask how did he do it, he simply replies, \"with the support of volunteers, friends and family.\" YRConfessions SG4SecondChances"

Suzana Ahmad, shared with us how her volunteering journey began with the Yellow Ribbon Project - a visit to Changi Prison five years ago which sparked her desire to help families affected by incarceration. Now as a Yellow Ribbon Champion, Suzana coordinates and manages the volunteers within her grassroots division. Having been a volunteer with the Yellow Ribbon Community Project for the past five years, Suzana has a selfless heart for reaching out to the loved ones of the incarcerated and providing support and assistance to help them cope. Tears flow as she recounts particular cases which have made lasting impressions. One of her first cases was when she organised Iftar (an evening meal Muslims end their daily Ramadan fast at sunset) for a family who had been coping with the husband's incarceration for the past 14 years. Help does not come only in terms of food but also education and counselling. Both spouses and children, who have been emotionally affected by the parent's incarceration, are given attention in the form of tutors or people whom they can confide in. \"(The) Yellow Ribbon Community Project is a bridge to reach out to the beneficiaries. There are a lot of people out there who need help and this project helps to open that door to helping them.\" Having many volunteers ready to help is a huge step in helping ex-offenders re-integrate back into society.

First held in 2005, the aim of the conference was to provide professionals with a platform to share best practices and discuss the rehabilitation, and reintegration of inmates and ex-offenders. Anthea, who is also the General Manager of Bright Services Company Limited (BSC), manages a social enterprise under the Society of Rehabilitation And Crime Prevention, which includes maintenance services, as well as a central kitchen and restaurant. Speaking with Anthea quickly broadened our perspectives on helping ex-offenders internationally. She compared the situation in Hong Kong to one not much different than the one we have in Singapore. Describing that community support was key, she highlighted that community and family support were paramount in re-integrating ex-offenders. Having been to Japan, China and Taiwan, Anthea shared that these countries are aware and very supportive of the cause we work for!

Running has also been a sports for her to bond with the people around her as she gets her family members and her friends to join her in races. Jasmine also shared her running tips for first time participants of the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run. Dont think about how long it would take you to complete the run. Just enjoy running with the people around you. Dont forget to warm up and cool down after the race. On why ex-offenders deserve a second chance, Jasmine shared that Everyone deserves a second chance. We should not be condemned just because we made a mistake. We must provide support for one another to re start a new journey!

Describing the competition as getting tougher and tougher every year, he describes happily that every year, the inmates bring more passion into their music. Rai spent his third year as the lead mentor getting every participant up to speed. Working closely with the participants, he guided them to better their compositions without losing the essence. When asked to share words of encouragement to aspiring musicians, both chimed: \"Keep practising, keep writing. Like chefs and soccer players, writing songs means putting it into practice and penning your thoughts down.\" Thank you to Jack, Rai, and everyone at COMPASS, for believing in second chances and for inspiring inmates to believe in themselves.

Since then, the shelter has helped over 100 women get back on their feet and successfully reintegrate back into society. The women are given social support, assistance in job placement and help with finding permanent housing arrangements. While the women wait for job placements, Auntie Leng teaches them how to bake and shares her special recipe for melt-in-the-mouth pineapple tarts and cookies so that the women are given the chance to earn an income and start their lives anew.. Some months are more challenging than others and Grace does not bring home a salary sometimes. Sometimes I ask myself what am I doing and whether it is all worth it, she says ruefully. However, she sees this as a calling to change how ex-offenders are viewed, especially female ex-offenders who have to overcome obstacles like bringing up children single-handedly.. When asked how the community can better help female ex-offenders, she simply says, I think we should have more compassion and dont be quick to judge others. If you would like to show your support, you can order Auntie Lengs cookies via our link on Facebook!. SG4SecondChances"

Johns journey started when he was placed on electronic home tagging and had strict curfew hours to abide by. The strict hours helped him gain discipline. At work, he never felt shunned: Everyone treats me normally, to them, I am not an offender, he recalled of his colleagues..

Do not get caught up in the hype and adrenaline and dash out from the start line.2. Do not try anything new, too, on race day. Do not wear new shoes for the first time on race day, as this will increase your chance of getting blisters.3. Hydrate yourself well! There will be enough water points on race day. Make use of them and drink at each water station.4. Grab a pre-workout snack two to three hours before the run and youre good to go!5. Lastly, put on your earpiece for some energetic songs to keep you going for the run."

During previous editions, the curator selected pieces for display after the inmates have completed it.

Working closely with the night festival, the theme illustrates their journey behind bars and actually came from the inmates.

With the support from both the Yellow Ribbon Fund STAR Bursary and allowance provided by Royal Plaza on Scotts, Mr Shaharuddin simultaneously undertook a Diploma in Culinary Skills from SHATEC. He has since been promoted to a 1st Cook as a result of his good work ethic and desire to learn. My ex-wife was asking for divorce at that time, that really made me change. All this while I promised my ex-wife, my kids, my mum and dad, and every one that I would change, but in the end I didnt. So now I needed to change for myself, before I can prove it to them that I can change. Mr Shaharuddin now acts as a mentor to other ex-offenders in the company, and is also a Peer Leader with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA), sharing his past experiences to help ex-offenders in their reintegration journeys. [Working with Shaharuddin] gave us the confidence that changes are really possible and theres a good source of manpower that we can really look at, says Ms Ong Pau Hsing Juliana, Director of Human Resources at Royal Plaza on Scotts.

The boy replied, Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The sea is up and the tide is out. If I dont throw them back, they will die. The man laughed to himself and said, Havent you realized that there are kilometres and kilometres of beach with hundreds of starfish stranded? You cant make a difference!

Ms Juliana shared how SCORE is dedicated to enhancing the employability of ex-offenders, as employment is a key factor in their successful reintegration into society. Other than being given opportunities to participate in work programmes during incarceration, SCORE helps prepare ex-offenders for work by ensuring that training provided is relevant so that employers will have greater confidence when hiring. The trainings are also aligned with the WDAs Workforce Skills Qualification Framework, ensuring offenders attend the same type of training as other Singaporean job seekers. Deepening the commitment to the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders, SCORE will be extending its job retention support to 12 months for ex-offenders this year. A differentiated approach will also be adopted to assist ex-offenders with differing levels of job fit and commitment. With the new approach, this will increase employers confidence in partnering SCORE to offer employment opportunities, added Ms Juliana. Together with the communitys support and ex-offenders determination, lets keep striving towards successful reintegration for these ex-offenders.SecondChancesEveryday"

Speaking to Mr. William Toh Chor Kok confirmed our belief that love goes a long way in changing lives. During his teenage years, Mr. Toh found himself in bad company, when he dabbled with drugs and became an addict soon after. He was apprehended by the police at the early age of 20 and found that the cycle of re-offending was immensely tough for him to break out of. As a result, he spent a total of 13 years in and out of drug rehabilitation centers.The turning point for him was when he saw the enduring love of his family, leading to him questioning his identity and future. Daunting thoughts on whether he would be known as a mere drug addict all his life and whether or not the cycle of re-offending would ever end caused him to realise that he needed to set his priorities straight and pick up important values such as discipline and abstinence, so that he could better continue on his journey of reformation.His journey of change was tough as it required him to make consistent and conscious decisions to do things that would help steer him on his journey of change. As a result of his determination, he was able to stand strong against the influences and become the person that he longed to become.Today, Mr. Toh spreads his love by volunteering with the Prison Fellowship Singapore, sharing with inmates how he had overcome his personal demons with the hope that they would be able to break out of the re-offending cycle too. During these sessions, he emphasises the need to believe and to hang on to love, as well as the importance for everyone to give their own self a second chance.SpreadYRLoveSecondChancesEveryday"

The 6km route takes you through our Happily Ever After Running Trail, which includes scenic and historical prison sites.Our Carnival will also include many interesting and meaningful activities for everyone to enjoy. Look out for a special performance by the Philharmonic Winds and inmate performers or explore our Rehab fair to find out more on how you can help in the reintegration efforts of ex-offenders.
