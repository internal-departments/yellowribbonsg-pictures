His journey hasn't been easy. Returning to a world that moved on without him, Andrew faced the weight of lost timestrained relationships, outdated skills, and the stigma that follows an incarceration record. Rebuilding trust with loved ones took patience. Adapting to rapid technological advancements meant relearning even the simplest daily tasks. Through it all, Andrew found strength in the very thing he advocates forcommunity. By surrounding himself with mentors, like-minded peers, and people who believed in his growth, he was able to navigate these challenges step by step. As he shares, \"What will turn an ex-offender away from prison is when he or she has communities of support that they can count on. When people feel seen, valued, and supported, they are more likely to thrive.\" YellowRibbonProject SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances ASecondChanceToMyself"

She turned her life around, living drug-free for decades. Her presence that day was a powerful message: *Its never too late to change. You are enough.* The inmates asked raw, valid questions about change and forgiveness. Mums life was the answerproof that no matter how far you fall, you can rise again.

You are enough.* The inmates asked raw, valid questions about change and forgiveness. Mums life was the answerproof that no matter how far you fall, you can rise again. This day also reminded me of my familys 30-year journey to reconciliation. My parents divorced, and Dad remarried, but by Gods grace and effort, weve built a close-knit family. I adore my step-siblings, Adam and Andrea, and cherish the love we share. Ive been blessed with an incredible support systemmy overprotective brother, Spencer, who stepped up as a parent, my amazing aunties, uncles, and my Granny, who taught me, *Nothing is impossible, and family is worth fighting for.* To the ladies at Changi: Keep the faith. Believe in yourselves. Your past doesnt define your future. Never give up. And to anyone reading: Family and love are worth fighting for. Healing is possible. Grateful to AGAPE and Changi Prison for this meaningful opportunity. Forgiveness Reconciliation SecondChances Hope Family NeverGiveUp LoveWins"

Having to maintain safe distancing meant that all training for inmate participants had to be conducted virtually. Judging, too, had to be conducted virtually and feedback was provided via video.

This was achieved together with support from the community by stitching together the largest patchwork blanket, measuring 20 x 24.6 meters. Comprising 15,255 hand-stitched patches, volunteers from the community contributed to the patchwork blanket as a symbol of the evolution of YRP - from raising awareness of the importance of giving second chances to ex-offenders and their families, to inspiring community actions through advocacy efforts. Thank you to our key partners from , Logwin Air + Ocean Singapore Pte Ltd, and the Zone 8 Sewing Interest Group, who also played an instrumental part in this significant achievement.

More than 100 members of the legal community were joined by local football legends Fandi Ahmad and K Kannan to raise funds for the Yellow Ribbon Fund (YRF) and the Singapore After-Care Association (SACA) They raised a record of $180,000 this year and have raised more than $710,000 since the first CJ's cup 11 years ago. This amount will support financially needy ex-offenders seeking vocational and skills training offered under the SAL-YRF Skills Training Assistance to Restart (STAR) Bursary and befriending services to the incarcerated and their families under SACA's Volunteer After-Care Programme.We would like to express our gratitude to the SAL and all the participants at the CJ's Cup for their dedication in supporting the education and rehabilitation of ex-offenders and their families, to offer second chances and hope to them.

He shared that the proceeds from the event don't just fund YRF's programmes, but community-led ones too. YellowRibbonFund YellowRibbonSingapore SG4SecondChances"

Visitors also joined a meaningful project, co-led by .happiness, to weave together recycled fabric in hopes of producing the largest patchwork blanket to enter the Singapore Book of Records, in support of inmates and ex-offenders.Support for the successful reintegration of ex-offenders was also displayed through the ThroughCare Journey exhibit! Participants hopped onto bicycles and with every 1km cycled, a yellow ribbon wall display lit up a little more. It stayed lit all weekend thanks to the efforts of one and all!Swipe through the recap photo album to witness the vibrant spirit of change and support.

Together, let's create a positive impact, break down barriers, and build a more inclusive society! YRSGxACI YellowRibbonSingapore YellowRibbonSG SG4SecondChances"

Even though they are currently serving their sentences, they took part in the run in their own way to give back to society ! Meet reformative trainee \"David\" and inmate \"Samuel\" (not their real names), both serving sentences at Institution TM1. \"David\" is a participant of this year's National Youth Achievement Awards (NYAA) Programme . Every week, they ran within their institutions as part of an initiative to give back to the community. Every kilometre they completed raised funds for beneficiaries of the Yellow Ribbon Project. We joined them for one of their runs to find out what they're running for and their thoughts on what makes a truly inclusive society! Show them your support in the comments below .

I was determined to show my value to society and my daughters.\" David King Thorairajan, an ex-offender, founder of life coaching programme, The Ministry of Empowerment, and father of two girls, ages six and nine, opens up about the unique challenges he faced and conquered on his journey to becoming a loving dad. \"Bonding with my kids wasn't always easy, especially when they grew older. But I've learnt that speaking their language, embracing their interests, and being a cool dad goes a long way.\" David recognises the importance of being a role model as a husband and father; both in the way he treats his wife and in his commitment to a healthy lifestyle. His determination to improve his health not only inspires his daughters but also ensures that he's there for them every step of the way. \"Consistency is key.

This project would not have come to fruition without the dedicated YRSG, SPS, and MOM staff to push through this initiative.\" Prior to Yellow Ribbon Singapore, Ms Tan worked at SPS as a CaptainOfLives and managed the daily operations of a Drug Rehabiliation Centre. Having worked in both in-care and aftercare, Ms Tan shared, \"I'm thankful to be able to contribute towards the broader mission of both SPS and YRSG, which is to reduce recidivism and help ex-offenders reintegrate into society.\" Congratulations, Ms Tan, on your well-deserved promotion!

Today, we're excited to share the story of Ellyana Bte Ramlee, on her journey as a mother and in particular, how she overcame challenges while serving time in prison. Ellyana shared how becoming a mother at a young age motivated her to work hard and provide the best for her son. \"I wanted to carry all the responsibilities on my own,\" she said. However, serving time in prison was a difficult time for Ellyana and her family, especially when it came to being separated from her son. \"It was heartbreaking to lie to my son about my whereabouts,\" she shared. Rebuilding her relationship with her son after her release was another obstacle for Ellyana. \"I had a lot of fears and doubts about myself,\" she shared. \"I didn't want him to be overwhelmed by my presence after being away for quite some time.\" Balancing motherhood and work can be challenging, but Ellyana tries to make the best of her off days, planning fun activities with her son. The most important lesson Ellyana hopes to pass on to her children is that \"it's okay to seek help if you need to. Nothing to be embarrassed about and it will not make you look weak.\" Ellyana's experience as a mother has also influenced her work with other ex-offenders and their families. \"I hope that my stories have educated them better and that they can seek treatment for their children from the different organisations that offer help,\" she said. For Mother's Day this year, Ellyana is celebrating with her family at home as it coincides with her son's 15th birthday. Thank you, Ellyana, for sharing your inspiring story with us! Happy Mother's Day! HappyMothersDay SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

He shared with us how he managed to turn his life around, after being admitted into the Singapore Boy's Home in his teenage years and eventually into prison.\"I constantly set goals for myself to keep me motivated and occupied. I also do a lot of volunteering work, such as engagements in Changi Prison Complex and juvenile homes, to make myself accountable, which reminds me not to go back to my old ways,\" he shared. As a business owner, Andyn has faced challenges because of his tattoos. But he continues to push forward and even hires ex-offenders, giving them a second chance. \"I am still open to giving anyone a second chance despite that,\" he said. Andyn discovered a passion for mountaineering while working in a gym for 18 years. He believes it can be an outlet for other ex-offenders too. \"It teaches me patience, humility, and resilience,\" he said, adding that he is always looking for like-minded sponsors to support his cause. For beginners who want to try mountaineering, Andyn recommends starting with day hikes in Malaysia before progressing to multiple-day hikes.SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

She is an avid tchoukball player who has played for about ten years since her polytechnic days. Her dedication to the sport is evident - she trains four days a week for her national and club training! For Li Qing, the best thing about playing tchoukball is the bond she shares with her teammates. \"We play the competition together, win/lose together, and cover for each other,\" she shared. Recently, Singapore's women's tchoukball team made history by becoming world champion, and she couldn't be prouder of her team's achievement. \"Getting champion for last year's Asia games led us to be world No. 1, but there was also a lot of hard work put in by all the other ex-national women players who helped us get there,\" she shared.When asked about the most important message she wants to send to young women thinking of pursuing sports in a male-dominated environment, Li Qing responded simply, \"Go for it!\" We love Li Qing's passion for sports and commitment to her job and tchoukball, and we hope her story can inspire more young women to persevere and pursue their passions!

After serving his most recent sentence in 2021, Chris was determined to start a new chapter in his life and pursue his dreams. Through hard work and determination, he eventually attained a Bachelors Degree in Social Sciences from .I met my wife, Elsa, when I was overseas during my student exchange in 2017. We got married in 2019. She re-located to Singapore in 2021 and we are finally living together after almost four years of long-distance relationship. It was difficult but we persevered and overcame the distance and difficulties.One of their fondest memories would be the time when they were walking along the streets of Hong Kong in the middle of the night. There was a light drizzle and as they neared Elsa's home, Chris stopped in the middle of the empty road, held up both her hands, looked into her eyes and asked her to be his girlfriend, to which she agreed! Chris goes on to describe how Elsa supported him, \"Many ex-offenders come out from prison broken, wounded, and doubtful of acceptance, but for me, Elsa's love and support were paramount in encouraging me, and guiding me through acceptance and validation.\"An integral member of their family, Big Nose has been with Chris for 10 years! The soft toy was a source of comfort for Elsa, who formed a strong attachment to it during Chris incarceration. Big Nose was with her throughout that time, and I believe that he is to her a personification of me. Now that all three of us are together, she would sometimes lament that I am spending more time with him than her!\" With a shared love of travelling and enjoying new experiences, Chris and Elsas story is a testament to the power of redemption, second chances, and the resilience of the human spirit. We hope that it inspires others to believe in the power of love and the possibility of a brighter future, no matter what their past may hold.Happy Valentine's Day!SG4SecondChances HappyValentinesDay"

When I found out that the theme for the Yellow Ribbon Community Arts Festival (YR CAF) 2022 was 'Home', I was lost and confused as I had never experienced or found a place I could call 'home'.I finally decided that I could paint what I would love to find in a home, hence the keyhole in the painting when I peep through it, it depicts whatever 'home' is to me, and what I want to see in it.\"In Sarah's (not real name) art, she expresses her hopes and desires through beautiful brush strokes and vibrant colours. She is also an aspiring tattoo artist; her parents have given their full blessings and hope to be there for her throughout her journey to success and reintegration into society!

        "caption": "Dr Felicia Low, a renowned visual artist and art educator since 1999, tells us about her involvement with CANVAS Art as a mentor, teaching inmates how to express themselves through their artworks with a creative flair. With the Yellow Ribbon Community Arts Festival (YR CAF) 2022, many inmate artists have a platform to share their talents and artwork in public. Lets find out more about Dr Lows experience in mentoring the inmates! ?It has been a great experience working with the inmates, especially in understanding their ideas and what they wish to achieve. All of the inmates talked about their families and wanted to express the meaning of their relationships with their loved ones through their artworks. Despite challenges, the inmates did their best to work with what they had and completed their artworks in their own unique way. ?There was one inmate who was afraid to paint anything bigger than A6 paper at the start. It took her about four weeks to finally have the confidence to paint on a larger piece of A1 paper, and she was able to do so independently. I was very proud that she was able to overcome her fears and was able to motivate herself to try something new towards a successful end.------ Enjoy meaningful artwork, beautiful poetry, baked treats, and live music performances over the weekend by supervisees and ex-offenders, at the YR CAF 2022, happening from 5 to 13 November 2022! Organised in collaboration with and , YR CAF 2022 is a one-of-a-kind experience that showcases creative expressions, allowing inmates and ex-offenders to convey their desires to change for a better future, for themselves and their families. Show your support for second chances. See you at the festival!YRCAF2022 SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

As an Assistant Associate, Transition Skills, Skills, he ensures that every beneficiary is given the opportunity to attend courses that allow them to gain the relevant industry skills required as part of their employment preparation.When asked about his greatest challenge at work, he shared that the COVID-19 pandemic had caused a disruption to the conduct of classes.\"At the national level, the government has relaxed safe management measures and we are gradually resuming our lives to pre-pandemic days. However, unlike classes conducted in public, classes conducted inside prisons could still be easily affected by the pandemic in view of the dense environment in prisons. It was definitely a challenge for our team, but with careful planning, we ensured that our beneficiaries were still able to receive the help and training needed in a safe environment.\"Hareez feels proud that his work at Yellow Ribbon Singapore expands the ex-offenders' employability skills, giving them a better chance at being employed and facilitating reintegration into society.

Shariff never lose hope, and picked himself up by starting to train as a runner. His motto: Set intention. Work for it. Learn from it. Never quit. Accept failures and challenges, and come back stronger. To date, he has completed 30 marathons, six ultra-marathons and other races, such as the annual Yellow Ribbon Prison Run (now rebranded to Yellow Ribbon Race) to show his support for inmates and ex-offenders who yearn for second chances. Apart from participating in the Virtual Race and Physical Run at the Changi Prison Complex on 25 September this year, Shariff will also participate in the first Gold Coast Marathon! Regardless of age, mobility or background, wed love to see everyone join the Yellow Ribbon Race 2022 this September and work towards creating a more inclusive society for not just ex-offenders, but everyone! Show your support for second chances and register for both the virtual and/or physical race! Click on link in bio. YRrace2022 SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

We noticed that he had given a unique name to the dish he cooked: Charlies Angels! Charlies Angels was my first encounter with western food, first cooked by my brother who has since passed on. It was a pivotal moment for me as I believed it ignited my passion for cooking. In a way, my late brother has planted this passion for cooking in me, right until now. Thus, this dish is my tribute to him. When asked if he was confident of winning the competition, he shared that he would try his best, but emphasised that his main reason for joining the competition was to try something new and enjoy the process. Over the last few days, weve shared a peek into the minds of the inmates participating in this years YRCC 2022. Are you curious to know who will win? Stay tuned for the Final Cook-Off!

We would sell all sorts of Malay cuisines, such as Mee Soto and Mee Rebus. I interpreted the theme of this years competition, A Taste of Home as food that is uniquely Singapore. Singapore is a multi-racial country with an array of food options to choose from.

During our conversation with 's Human Capital & Development Manager, Mr Kelvin Ho, we learnt about its ongoing initiatives to support inmates and ex-offenders in their career development and employment prospects. The Pan Pacific Hotels Group has been a strong advocate of inclusive employment from across diverse backgrounds and communities, and these efforts have created a more compassionate working environment for our workforce. Im glad that at our hotel, this compassion has extended to supporting ex-offenders in their reintegration into society. With an avid commitment to providing employment and skills training to ex-offenders, Mr Ho shares with us, For ex-offenders, we should continue to be their advocates by sharing success stories of rehabilitation, career progression and their assimilation back to society. As a business, we must also continue to extend support to them and listen to them, just as we would for any other associate on our team. This helps us to understand their situation, needs and in managing expectations. We will then be able to support the ex-offenders in their reintegration journey and help them to achieve their goals.YRConnects SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

In 2008, I was interested in curry puffs after trying some really tasty ones at the hawker centre. I thought that there was room for improvement, so I experimented with the fillings and the pastry. It took me many attempts before I was confident enough to share them with my friends and family. I also distributed them to patrons at the hawker centre to gather feedback on my curry puffs. Many of them were very shocked when they bit into the huge fillings of my curry puffs! This gave me the confidence to start selling them. . ? I hope that he will grow up to be bright and successful.

With the support of trade associations, employers, and government agencies, we can work together for the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders. At the recent YR Connects event, Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) had the opportunity to connect with industry players, trade associations and employers. Singapore Logistics Associations (SLA) CEO, Mr Oh Bee Lock shares on the ongoing initiatives that support inmates and ex-offenders in their career development and employment opportunities. Such events are important as it helps us connect and learn about facilitating the reintegration of ex-offenders to better support and give them second chances. We hope inmates and ex-offenders who are actively looking for employment will be equipped with industry-relevant knowledge and skills, and at the same time enable employers to engage and better understand the needs of these job seekers, said Mr Oh, who believes that education and skills training are essential for the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders.The Logistics Academy, a wholly owned subsidiary of SLA that was set up in 2010, is committed to providing quality training and lifelong learning for the logistics workforce.

Her volunteering journey began in 2021, when she was inspired to do more for second chances after a surreal vision of a divine guide showed her a sign of unravelling yarn. This sparked her desire to help inmates and ex-offenders. At 22, Yen Ee and her team from are dedicated to her volunteer work with Yellow Ribbon Project that spans from teaching other volunteers how to crochet, as well as guiding over 50 inmates and ex-offenders to learn the craft. She also pioneered the Yellow Ribbon crochet pattern, which can be viewed here: \"It is good to know that I taught someone a skill, so that they might feel proud of themselves for creating something out of nothing,\", Yen Ee shared, hoping to provide support to help inmates cope. There are a lot of people out there who need help and this project helps to open that door to giving them an outlet to cope and perhaps even use this craft to start their own ventures in the future, and I would appeal to the youth to use their unique talents and crafts to volunteer as well, as having volunteers ready to help is a huge step in rehabilitation and reintegration for many.

Incarcerated for drug-related offences, Ridwans enthusiasm for music never waned. I started playing the guitar in primary school. However, I picked up playing the keyboard five years ago, while in the prison. It was during my incarceration that I managed to attain the Basic Music Class Grade 5 as well. The Ritchie Blackmore and Yngwie Malmsteen fan shares that his passion for music has motivated him to stay clean, and with his loved ones support for his musical inclinations, he has been able to free his mind from stress. At the end of the day, second chances are important for recovery and reintegration, and an opportunity to showcase our talents can go a long way in motivating former offenders like us to stay on the right path!

This was the reintegration experience for Grace, a Customer Service Team Leader at XDel Singapore Pte Ltd. I was imprisoned for drug offences for almost six years and because of that, I could not take care of my family. While serving my sentence, I reflected and decided to turn over a new leaf, so I resumed my education while in prison. I was eventually selected for the Community-based Programme and placed in a halfway house. Worried about her past affecting her career options, Grace was ecstatic to find XDel Singapore assessing her purely based on her own merits. They made me feel very comfortable and offered me the opportunity to work for them. Today, Grace credits XDel for turning her life around. For Grace, employment support went a long way in stabilising and anchoring her reintegration journey. Thank you XDel for believing in second chances, and giving Grace self-confidence, a sense of purpose and the opportunity to successfully reintegrate into society.

Now they are well-adjusted, and are very good at what they do.One of their recent recruits is Muhd Yusof - an aspiring Captain who is on his way to a Steersman license. It has helped a lot.

I began with marijuana at the age of 13, and this led me to heroin addiction at the age of 15. Being dependent on these drugs, I also ended up in the company of gangs and I was arrested for the first time at the age of 22.For the well-known Triad Trails, Bruce, a charismatic tour leader, shared the historical secrets that Singapores Central Business District conceals. It gives ex-offenders like me, an opportunity to have conversations that otherwise would not be possible, as it gives our tourists the liberty to ask us about our past without hesitation.As an advocate for youths-at-risk, Bruce dedicates his time to give talks at schools, and train to be a street journalist. He also spends quality time with his family. He highlighted that people are sometimes judgmental and slow to trust those with criminal pasts. Thus, he wants to help ex-offenders have a good support system when they are released to reduce their chances of re-offending.A believer in faith, he shared that change often comes from within. Many ex-offenders and their families approach me for help and support after their release from prisons, and I truly feel that unless there is an innate desire for change within a person, its difficult to bring about a large-scale change to society. But I would like to tell our society and community to take a chance on us, as those of us who are serious about changing our lives are some of the most hardworking and sincere people you will meet.SG4SecondChances BeyondSecondChances"

A conversation with Mr Christopher Yeow, the oldest participant for this years Yellow Ribbon Virtual Run (YRVR), is a refreshing reminder that age is truly just a number. I have been a Toastmasters Prison Volunteer for over 15 years and often take the opportunity to support the Yellow Ribbon activities whenever I can.\" Keeping healthy became a priority for Mr Yeow, an adjunct lecturer at Nanyang Polytechnic, after he discovered that physiotherapy and regular exercise help him with knee pain five years ago. In his mission to stay active, he persevered and has been an ardent supporter of the Yellow Ribbon cause. During this COVID-19 period, the YRVR allowed me to enjoy the outdoors, walking around the neighbourhood and beyond to discover new sights and surprising things that I was not aware of before. He also shared that some of his favourite walking spots are around Bedok Park Connector, where he takes in the sights of nature, as well as creative murals and art pieces along the way. Mr Yeow hopes to encourage others to be involved in rehabilitation efforts. In doing so, we will develop empathy for inmates and ex-offenders, and at the same time, help them unlock their second prisons. YRVR2021 YRInspire2021 ChallengeYRself SG4SecondChances"

Erics passion for supporting ex-offenders in their rehabilitation and reintegration goes back to 1968, when he, then 17-year-old, played guitar at Changi Prison for Prison Chapel Services. Over the years, he opted to become a prison counsellor and has continued his legacy of helping inmates for the past 54 years. .The first time my dad invited me to join him in the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run was 5 years ago, for a 10km run. The finishing point was at the prison compound itself. It was astonishing and admirable. I felt a deep connection because of my Dad. I understood the meaning of the years of his dedication to the cause and that somehow sparked my interest in the Yellow Ribbon cause too. .Running with dad is like running with a man with a legacy in volunteer work who does not quit. That, I feel, is my fondest memory for this years run. During our runs, he would share wonderful stories with me of many inmates who have mended their ways and done well for themselves after their incarceration.

Their graduation ceremony, which was held virtually, was attended by several media representatives and potential employers.Id like to take this opportunity to thank YRSG for their support and effort in helping inmates and ex-offenders achieve their goals. Their motto has always been second chances and I am one of the many examples of second chances that YRSG has helped so that everyone like myself can have a brighter future, shares Adam (pseudonym), an inmate who graduated from the programme.A collaboration between YRSG and made this programme a success. The partnership resulted in the establishment of a media training academy inside prison to enhance the skills and career prospects of inmates and ex-offenders in the media industry. The four-month SMMOCC diploma programme and 10-month DMAD programme started in November 2020, with lessons taking place twice a week. Through three cohorts per year, YRSG expects to train about 60 inmates.Employment is the cornerstone to successful reintegration. When ex-offenders are gainfully employed, it gives them a sense of personal fulfilment to be able to contribute to their families well-being. I am grateful that employers continue to hire ex-offenders and extend second chances to them during this difficult period. said Mr Matthew Wee Yik Keong, Chief Executive Officer, YRSG.Congratulations to all the graduates, and a special thanks to the staff for facilitating the conduct of the programme, which allows for more doors on second chances to be opened for the inmates.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

        "caption": "A desire to help the underprivileged or those who are in difficult situations is exactly what motivated Ms Rachael to join Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG).Ms Rachaels scope of work includes conducting career assessments to guide inmates to discover their career interests and guide them towards preparing themselves to apply for jobs. Within this process, she engages with inmates on a one-to-one basis regularly, and coordinates job interviews with potential employers to help inmates secure suitable employment before their release. ?The successful implementation of virtual job interviews in prisons. When COVID-19 hit Singapore and we entered the Circuit Breaker, ex-offenders released during that time were unable to receive employment assistance before their release. The team worked hard to introduce technology into our work processes and enabled employers to resume interviews with ex-offenders virtually. This allowed our work to continue, while keeping everyone safe. ?Building rapport with the inmates and ex-offenders and listening to them. Some of them can be quite inspiring and cause us to reflect on our life choices. At the end of the day, its a fulfilling job. Everyday might bring new challenges to my job, but when I hear that they are successful in staying out of prison, its a joy for sure. --------- If you are looking for a fulfilling career and have the heart to help others change for the better, do visit to join us. Together, we can support the Yellow Ribbon cause and inspire collective action for An Inclusive Society, a Nation Beyond Second Chances. SG4SecondChances"

As the Managing Director of Antara Koh Pte Ltd, Dr Koh has been involved in some instrumental moments in Singapores history, including the relocation of the Merlion to the promontory in front of The Fullerton Hotel. As a YRF partner, Dr Koh has contributed in many YRF initiatives that have been rolled out to provide rehabilitation and reintegration services to ex-offenders and their families, such as the YRF STAR Bursary, which assists low-income ex-offenders in pursuing further education after release. What I realise is that every jail sentence meted out to punish the wrongdoing of a person must serve a social purpose. The society must be compassionate and help to rehabilitate those who were jailed to return to the society and to be good citizens. The society must help to mitigate the suffering of innocent members of the family, especially the children. We must help to support their daily needs, provide them the education and training to help them to reintegrate into society. Dr Koh hopes that with his efforts, as well as every individuals support, society can facilitate the rehabilitation of ex-offenders and support their families through difficult times.

In that time, their resolve to become a better version of themselves increases with every passing day. All they ask is for a second chance. Ex-offenders are no different from you and me, all striving to build a better tomorrow. Look beyond the past, treasure the present, create a bright future. Lucas Lam, Singapore Media AcademyAs a first-time participant for this years inaugural Yellow Ribbon Virtual Run, Singapore Media Academys (SMA) Lucas Lam hopes that this event will raise awareness to the cause of the Yellow Ribbon Project, and encourage employers to hire ex-offenders. Mr Lam describes how SMAs diploma enriches the lives of inmates and provides them with the right tools that aid their reintegration process after release. He shared, We partnered YRSG to kick off the inaugural batches for two diploma programmes to selected inmates in November 2020. The main objectives of both programmes is to arm the inmates with industry relevant skills with hands-on training to be able to join the workforce.Join us and support second chances - link in bio!YRVR2021 YRInspire2021 ChallengeYRself SG4SecondChances"

        "caption": "Para-athlete Shariff Abdullah ( ), more popularly known as Blade Runner, has been running for second chances for over a decade. He took part in his first ever Yellow Ribbon Prison Run in 2010, after reading about the cause. Perseverance despite challenging circumstances are qualities Shariff embodies in his personal life. He shares that whenever he is down, he watches YouTube videos of runners and encourages himself. He draws the same philosophy when it comes to encouraging inmates and ex-offenders to do better. They need someone to push them and support them to stay on the right track. We as a community can do just that!Since 2010, the running enthusiast has never looked back. Shariff runs every year to rally societal support for ex-offenders. In 2014, I ran with a 8kg weighted bag to represent the burdens some ex-offenders face when they are released, shared the ardent runner.This year, Shariff is back for the Yellow Ribbon Virtual Run 2021, running 60km to raise support for the cause. Join him during his live run on 5 September at 8am as he runs for second chances!This year I dedicate my run to inmates and ex-offenders, as well as the staff who do their best to support inmates and ex-offenders!YRVR2021 YRInspire2021 ChallengeYRself SG4SecondChances"

Denises colleagues in Aftercare go beyond just helping ex-offenders, and often extends aid to the families of ex-offenders, who are consequently impacted by their incarceration.Aftercare is important as we help ex-offenders to unlock the second prison of social stigmatisation, which they may potentially face after their release. Being able to help others, drives a sense of purpose in my work and motivates me to do more to positively impact the lives of our beneficiaries. To individuals who have the passion and interest for a job that is more than just social work and prioritises helping others this is the job for you.If you are looking for a fulfilling career and have the heart to help others change for the better, do visit to join us. Together we can support the Yellow Ribbon cause and inspire collective action for An Inclusive Society, a Nation Beyond Second Chances. SG4SecondChances"

He called me one night and told me he was contemplating suicide as he felt lost and did not know how to deal with the situation. I worked with him through his troubles and gave him the SOS hotline number to call. For the next few weeks, we would talk constantly, and he slowly regained his confidence and determination to overcome his challenges. Eventually, when he was ready, I managed to arrange for him a job which met his salary request at a logistics factory. A year later, he called me on Chinese New Year to express his gratitude and informed me that he had been promoted at work.Employment is the foundation of every individuals livelihood, helping sustain individuals and their families. As a career coach, Bryan rebuilds the lives of ex-offenders by creating employment opportunities for them to take charge of their rehabilitation and create stability in their own lives. He also assists them in overcoming challenges at work and manages other barriers they might face during their reintegration journey. On-site job visits, check-ins with employers and engaging clients the day of a career coach is hectic but rewarding. The effort from a career coach can create a ripple effect that can ultimately change an ex-offenders and their familys lives for the better.If you are looking for a fulfilling career and have the heart to help others change for the better, do visit to join us.

It felt like they were so near, yet so far. I asked myself why I was being so selfish, leaving them behind and giving them trouble... I had to change.Its been three years since Ramachandrans release. He remains determined to stay on the right path and provide for his family. He is also an active volunteer with Industrial and Services Co-operative Society Limited (ISCOS), where he speaks to inmates through outreach programmes in prisons.Looking back, Ramachandran recalled that his arrest had changed things for his family. In his absence, his wife juggled between her job and taking care of their three children. While in prison, Ramachandran felt a sense of loss to be away from his family and guilty that he had missed out on their milestones and birthdays. Family support, Ramachandran says, was the driving force that kept him going. It motivated him to stay positive and eventually pushed him to turn his life around for good.I hope to be a living testament for those who feel like they have no guidance, those who feel hopeless or even someone who needs a listening ear. I also want to assure my family that Im here now, and I will be here with them all the way no matter what. HappyFathersDay BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

        "caption": "Growing up, Hannah struggled with self-acceptance and loneliness. She was always looking to filling up a void she had. So she chased for validation and attention in the hope to attain fulfilment.This led her down a rabbit hole of constant partying and drugs. Even after her imprisonment in 2002 for drug related offences, Hannah continued taking drugs after her release.All that changed when Hannah had her son. He reminded her of the struggles she had while growing up, and motivated her to change for the better to provide a better life for him. I didnt want him to grow up like how I did, and I didnt want to affect him with the state I was in, said Hannah. Today, Hannah is a proud mother of four and spends her time volunteering at The Turning Point, a womens halfway house which provides structured aftercare support for offenders. She also leads a team of volunteers to counsel individuals who need guidance.It has been 16 years since Hannahs last release from prisons, and she hopes to carry the lessons from her past to inspire others to lead better life. My past gave me an opportunity to share how dust can turn into diamonds. Ex-offenders are walking through a journey which has many steps behind an average human being. So let's all be kind and have patience. The more love they receive, the more they are strengthened and motivated from within. When you show kindness to them, you may not know that you are contributing to their healing.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

It all started 10 years ago when ShaEffa had her first encounter with drugs. Curious about the experience, ShaEffa decided to try it for the first time and she became addicted. Now 35 and a mother of five, ShaEffa turned her life around and works as a full-time baker to support her family.\"My parents sacrificed a lot for me when I was in prison. And as a mom myself, being in prison affected me deeply because I realised Im getting older, and my kids are growing up as well. I didnt want to disappoint them. Im grateful to my family for their support and encouragement. They gave me the wings I needed to carry on.To all mothers in recovery, you must stay strong even when it gets difficult. Never give up. You still can make-up for the time youve lost.Motherhood is a journey of discovery and growth for many. For our ex-offenders, the support from family and those close to them will aid in this journey and encourage them to go the distance. Thank you to all moms who have also worked tirelessly to provide for their children and families. HappyMothersDay BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

For Hanz, her grandfathers brush with death changed her perspective on life and encouraged her to quit her life of crime. Back then, I was living a life without goals and discipline. I was around addicts, those selling illegal cigarettes and many others. My day only started when others ended theirs. I would sleep in the morning, and once the sun goes down thats when my day would start.During a family visit while she was still incarcerated, Hanzs parents shared that her grandfather had suffered from a heart attack, and in his moments of consciousness, called out for Hanz to come to him. That was a blow. I panicked and asked if he was ok. They said yes but said that he was still calling for me. That really motivated me to stay clean and finish my sentence. The fear of losing a loved one while being inside... its something you will regret, said Hanz.With the support of her family, Hanz has stayed crime free for the past 10 years. Now 32, Hanz is a manager at a popular retail store and is looking forward to owning her first home.After all the support and hard work, Ive finally managed to get my own house. Im waiting to collect my keys now. Im thankful to my bosses and general manager who have always believed in me and trusted me, Hanz shared with gratitude.We are all the same, though the path we choose might be different. Everyone makes mistakes, and they just need that opportunity to change. The support we receive will help in our journey of finding our way home.BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

Every individuals journey is different, but the ones who eventually succeed are those who do not give up, and persevere through multiple successes and failures.During the journey of desistance, it is important to understand that successes and failures are not defined by incidents of relapse or abstinence. Rather, we should look out for small steps of successes during their journeys, and encourage them to choose actions which bring them closer to their end goal of a fulfilling life.Desistance is an ongoing process that requires full commitment from individuals, those close to them, and society.

Yusuf (pseudonym) had always been stable so we didnt suspect anything.\" Despite Yusufs mischievous and cheeky demeanor as a kid, nothing in his behavior would have prepared his family for his string of arrests later on. He had never shown signs of drug addiction. But it was after his first divorce when things started going downhill. The subsequent relationships he had were unhealthy, and they even did drugs together. I tried not to be too involved because he was an adult, but I remained hopeful and continued supporting him, said his sister, Farah (pseudonym).During his first two sentences, I supported him financially when he was released. I also wanted him to be more financially stable, so I got him a job as a Grab driver. But I told him that he needs to help himself too. I even asked him Do you want to change your habits or change your address to Changi Prison?Things took a turn when their father suffered a stroke during Yusufs third incarceration. This was a wake-up call for him, as he came to the realization that he could lose his father while being incarcerated. With Farahs help and coordination, Yusuf was able to speak to his father again.During the pandemic, we made phone calls instead of tele-visits. Otherwise my dad would not have been well enough to leave the house. In the call, Yusuf told our dad that he would pray for him and hopefully be able to see him again soon. My dad was very happy to hear this as he had been asking about Yusuf, said Farah.Yusuf is thankful for the support he has received and plans to join his family in the construction industry after his release in 2021.The support from Yusufs sister will be one of the critical factors for his successful reintegration.

Left on their own, some face struggles when trying to reintegrate into society. The inmates release pack was piloted by the Yellow Ribbon Fund (YRF) in late 2019 to help ex-offenders find their footing as they take their first steps beyond the prison gates. Specially curated with vouchers and pre-loaded cards to address their basic needs from clothing, grocery to transport, the pack also includes handy information on social support organizations which ex-offenders can seek for help. Thanks to the support of like-minded partners like CIMB, more than 1,170 ex-offenders have been provided with this release pack since the projects inception in 2019. It has helped to lighten the financial and practical concerns of the ex-offenders especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative has been very well received and we look forward to more community partnership with other agencies."

        "caption": "I called my sister to tell her that I was going to bail myself out and run away. It was then she told me that moms cancer had relapsed. It was stage four again.These were the last words Gary (pseudonym) heard before his court sentencing for his third imprisonment.I was prepared to be on the run. But I knew I would never see my mom again. I told my friends, Dont bail me out. I will just go. said Gary.Gary was first imprisoned in 2000 for drug possession. He shared that it was through friends that he came to know about drugs. He relapsed in 2004, and served an additional three years behind bars. During his second imprisonment, he shared that the opportunities that he received then that kick-started his culinary journey.Prisons gave me a lot of chances to excel. I had the chance to head Dining Behind Bars (DBB), and they allowed me to select and lead the whole team. I was the very first executive chef for DBB and was glad to pull through many events with exciting menus. Through all the events, I managed to upgrade myself.But it wasnt until his third imprisonment that Gary decided to quit his old lifestyle for good. I was married before my last imprisonment and was doing well in life. But my biggest mistake was when I started to get close to drugs again. This was when my moms cancer relapsed.Today, Gary is the successful owner of several culinary and consultancy businesses. He is grateful for the help he received during his imprisonment and seeks to give back by hiring ex-offenders for his own company. When inmates are released from prisons, they really try their best. But they get hindered by so many setbacks, it brings their patience and confidence down. The unlocking of the second prison plays a big part and I hope that families do their best to support them. Else it would be difficult (for their rehabilitation). said Gary.And to other inmates, when you are released, you need to have a goal. Whether its long or short term, big or small goals it doesnt matter. If you dont have a goal, you will find that your life is pointless. You may do things that could eventually hurt your family.

He was eventually arrested and placed behind bars.Now 29, Jordan (pseudonym) hopes to make amends and put his past behind him.Since 2020, hes been making the most of his days after being emplaced at The Helping Hand (THH) one of eight halfway houses that work with Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in providing transitional support for ex-offenders.Back then, my life felt aimless. I didnt have any goals. Even if I had a goal, I would stop halfway when it got difficult. I always thought I could stop (taking drugs) when I wanted to, but its not that easy. In fact, it just got worse and I was desperately hooked.All that changed when Jordan learnt of his grandmothers passing. It was a wake-up call that spurred him to take charge of his life.We were very close from the beginning. The sudden loss made me miserable as I always confided in her. We got even closer when she was battling cancer, and her passing made me feel like I lost a part of myself.After losing her, I told myself that I wanted to stay clean and be there for all my loved ones. Time is short, I dont want to waste it anymore. I dont want to attend another funeral in prison clothing.Today, Jordan is serving the tail end of his sentence as an Assistant at THHs urban farm, where he helps to cultivate fishes and a vegetation site. With the support from THH, Jordan has also received his admission to study for a diploma at a polytechnic.As he looks forward to his future ahead, Jordan also hopes to inspire other ex-offenders to lead their best life.I hope I can use my story to change someone elses life. Patience is important when we are first released from prison. Just like farming, rehabilitation is a process. A good life doesnt mean every day will be smooth sailing. Dont give up.To the community out there, I hope you can be more patient with us. For people like us, when we are first released, we are quite lost and for many, they dont really have any family support.DrugFreeSg BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

        "caption": "At the tender age of 14, he started using drugs with friends on a recreational basis. But this addiction grew into a habit that was beyond his control. He was eventually arrested and placed behind bars.Now 29, Jordan (pseudonym) hopes to make amends and put his past behind him.Since 2020, hes been making the most of his days after being emplaced at The Helping Hand (THH) one of eight halfway houses that work with Singapore Prison Service (SPS) in providing transitional support for ex-offenders.Back then, my life felt aimless. I didnt have any goals. Even if I had a goal, I would stop halfway when it got difficult. I always thought I could stop (taking drugs) when I wanted to, but its not that easy. In fact, it just got worse and I was desperately hooked.All that changed when Jordan learnt of his grandmothers passing. It was a wake-up call that spurred him to take charge of his life.We were very close from the beginning. The sudden loss made me miserable as I always confided in her. We got even closer when she was battling cancer, and her passing made me feel like I lost a part of myself.After losing her, I told myself that I wanted to stay clean and be there for all my loved ones. Time is short, I dont want to waste it anymore. I dont want to attend another funeral in prison clothing.Today, Jordan is serving the tail end of his sentence as an Assistant at THHs urban farm, where he helps to cultivate fishes and a vegetation site. With the support from THH, Jordan has also received his admission to study for a diploma at a polytechnic.As he looks forward to his future ahead, Jordan also hopes to inspire other ex-offenders to lead their best life.I hope I can use my story to change someone elses life. Patience is important when we are first released from prison. Just like farming, rehabilitation is a process. A good life doesnt mean every day will be smooth sailing. Dont give up.To the community out there, I hope you can be more patient with us. For people like us, when we are first released, we are quite lost and for many, they dont really have any family support.DrugFreeSg BeyondSecondChances SG4SecondChances"

However, some may experience a disconnect with the world that has seemingly moved on without them. Apart from catching up with the society, many are also fighting to remove the label that society has placed on them.For this years Happiness Film Festival, the Happiness Initiative will be screening six international films, each paired with a local film followed by a dialogue that explores issues faced by vulnerable and marginalized groups. In partnership with The Happiness Initiative, we will also be discussing second chances and rediscovery for ex-offenders, and how we can better support their journey.Join us on 27 March 2021 (Saturday) at Filmgarde Bugis+ to catch the movie Skid Row Marathon a movie about a judge who inspires the homeless, addicts and ex-offenders through a running club.

For this years competition, the Yellow Ribbon Project (YRP) and the Association (SCA), ran its first-ever virtual cooking competition with the theme Recipe for Change. This was inspired by Singapores resilience to overcome the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the motivation within the inmates to develop their own recipes for change during their rehabilitation journey. Prior to the formal runs of the competition, inmate participants also underwent culinary training with professional chef mentors from SCA: Dexter Lim, an Executive Sous Chef at TWG Tea Singapore; and Royce Lee, Head Chef in Research & Development of Food Products at H&Z Mart Pte Ltd. Royce is also an ex-offender and he wanted to contribute to the competition as a mentor, not only to impart his culinary knowledge but also to inspire the inmates to successfully turn their lives around and give back to the community like he did.In a YRCC first, each participant also had their dishes prepared with love delivered to their families.Do share with us your favourite dish in the comments below!

        "caption": "The work of a career coach is often hectic and demanding. From engaging ex-offenders to understanding their needs, as well as on-site job visits and check-ins with their employers, being a career coach is challenging but a rewarding and meaningful job!In celebration of the International Womens Day this year, we speak to Julie Watt, who is one of the 13 career coaches at the Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG), to find out more about her passions and role as a career coach.While studying Criminology, Julie learnt that people are driven by certain factors (social, environmental or personal choice) to commit crimes. On a more personal level, she also felt compelled to help the needy like inmates and ex-offenders, and wanted a hands-on career that allows her to pursue her passion to help. With these ambitions in mind, she accepted a job as a career coach at YRSG.My favorite part of the job is when I am able to go on-site and engage the supervisees to understand their situations in a more in-depth manner. Understanding their stories allows me to build rapport with them. They also become more comfortable and I gain their confidence and trust that YRSG is able to make a difference in their lives. Being in this field also poses its own set of challenges, such as management and prioritization of supervisees needs. However, Julie is grateful to her reporting officer, Siti Aishah, for her guidance through the different cases, and has also learnt to organize and plan her work week to better manage her time.But on her most hectic days, it is the outcome of making a positive difference in the lives of others that keeps her going.I had an ex-offender whom I managed previously. She shared that she was grateful to have me as her career coach. The ex-offender said she appreciated the way I encouraged and motivated her. That made her want to work towards being a better version of herself. To Julie Watt and other women who are passionate about making a positive difference in the lives of others, we celebrate your achievements in helping to create an inclusive world!BeyondSecondChances CelebratingSGWomen ChooseToChallenge"

It gives them a routine and structured lifestyle that they can follow through as they make the transition from prison life. It is also an opportunity for them to contribute back to society.Thanks to the continued support from employers, we saw an increase of almost 300 employers who have registered with Yellow Ribbon Singapore (YRSG) in 2020 to provide job support programmes for inmates prior to their release.

It all came to a halt after he was reported to the authorities by his so-called friends.From his fast-paced life as a fitness trainer and commercial diver who frequently travelled the world, it was a stark contrast to his life in prison. This also severely impacted his relationship with his family.Fortunately for Johnson, things took a turn for the better after he met his career coach, Bryan who handed him the second chance he needed to get back on his feet again.Hear all about it via or tap the link in our bio!"

However, I have also seen the unspoken impact it has on some of them through their expressions and that for me hits home on the work we need to continue doing to bridge the gap.Additionally, through the support of my fellow committee members who each are experts in their own fields, all this has inspired me to continue volunteering for YRF.Despite disruptions during the COVID-19 period, YRF continues to offer support to beneficiaries in need of help. More than $400,000 has been set aside by YRF to support ex-offenders, families and children of the incarcerated for initiatives such as the Yellow Ribbon Emergency Fund (YREF), YRF-Residential Aftercare Support Programme (RASP) and CARE Packs for Families of Incarcerated.If you require assistance from YRF, please reach out to cheryl_poon.gov.sg."

For Kasmawati, she was the sole caregiver and parental figure to her son when she was released in 2013. She juggled between jobs, housing loans and supporting her son - often dealing with her problems alone. She was not always optimistic about her situation but shared that it was her family and community who helped pull her through rough times.I aim to be a better person for my family. They constantly remind me not to go back to my old ways. My community and neighbours are helpful too they always give me encouragement.Kasmawati also credits her progress to her counsellor, Janet. She had received counselling from the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA) for six months after her release, but continued after as it had helped her tremendously.Janet was very helpful. When I was released, she always called me to check up on me and showed me where to ask for help. I realised that if people want to help me, I should also help myself.Today, Kasmawati is a therapist to stroke patients at SynPhNe Pte Ltd and is also involved in rehabilitative and community work. She is the project chairwoman for various community projects and continues to take up volunteer work in her free time.When asked what advice she would share with other ex-offenders who might be struggling, Kasmawati said, Dont lose hope. You need to have more determination and goals for yourself. Focus for a better life you can do it.SG4SecondChancesBeyondSecondChances"

The e-tuition has also proven to be beneficial to Daniel, who was lagging behind in his studies before he started his lessons.

Lets hear from some of the elderlies on how they feel about receiving them!I am happy to see that the care pack has mask and hand sanitiser, which are essential items I can use during this period, said Mdm Rahamat. Another senior, Mdm Chia said, I am grateful that the care pack has reusable masks, as I can use it whenever I go out.Initiatives that engage our inmates and ex-offenders to contribute back to the community are made possible from our generous donors like Mr Philip Lim, who has been a long-time supporter of the Yellow Ribbon Project. Mr Lim said, It is indeed a pleasure to be able to contribute to the welfare of our senior citizens during this period of COVID-19. This care pack will be beneficial in helping them stay safe. Thank you Mr Lim for your support towards the Yellow Ribbon Project!BeyondSecondChances SGUnited"

Last week, Vijay and his team volunteered to deliver more than 100 care packs to our beneficiaries using his company resources. I know the struggle of trying to make ends meet, as I have travelled down that path before. I wanted to contribute as much as possible to lessen the burden of fellow Singaporeans who are bearing the brunt of this pandemic and the best way was to deliver care packs to the beneficiaries, said Vijay. Be prepared to work hard and success will eventually come your way, said Vijay when asked to give advice to other ex-offenders who are beginning to reintegrate into society. As an ex-offender himself, he hopes that others can adopt an attitude of resilience in the face of failure and not expect instant success. The journey to a successful reintegration may be a long road ahead, but through courage and perseverance, Vijay has proven that anything is possible and second chances are worth fighting for.BeyondSecondChances"

YRI is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) that provides work programme to inmates during their incarceration. At YRI Bakery, inmates undergo on-the-job-training and certified bakery courses which equip them with skills in preparation for their release. Swipe through to take a virtual walk with Thurston at the Bakery.Thurston finds meaning in making an impact on the lives of inmate bakers. Some skills he has imparted to the incarcerated bakers are time management, communication skills and positive work ethics. These are not just key traits that a baker needs but also employability skills that are invaluable outside the prison.His day-to-day job includes training inmate bakers and briefing them on the safety procedures in the kitchen. After a few years working in the Bakery, Thurston is now able to identify each inmate bakers key strengths and interests. He then places them in the relevant departments in the Bakery. Day-to-day conversations between inmates help them learn from one another. \"As much as inmates learn from me, I have also learnt a lot from them,\" says Thurston.Thinking back, Thurston shared that when some of the inmates were first introduced to the Bakery, they were apprehensive. They felt that baking was not their calling. It wasnt until they witnessed their finished products did they realise that their efforts had a sweet reward. This in turn inspired them to bake more and some even requested their loved ones to send them new recipes to try!What is one life lesson learnt while working at the Bakery? Thurston shared, \"Never judge a book by its cover. Even though they are here to serve their term, some of them are very talented.\" BeyondSecondChances"

Volunteers were needed to help deliver these 6,000 packets of freshly baked cookies to the many healthcare institutions around Singapore. Residents from various halfway houses The Helping Hand, Green Haven, Teen Challenge (Singapore) and HEB-Ashram Halfway House responded to this clarion call for action by stepping forward.Through this exercise, our inmates and ex-offenders have come together to show their appreciation to the 'Guardians and Angels' amongst us, in their own ways. \"I feel very proud to be a part of this initiative, as I can see many frontliners who are doing good work and taking on extra duties to make sure that everything is moving in an orderly manner. I pray for their safety and thank them for their sacrifices, said Siva from The Helping Hand halfway house.We hope that our 'Guardians and Angels' will enjoy these cookies, find some warmth and comfort, and take great care of themselves during this critical period!

After receiving support from the Yellow Ribbon Fund STAR Bursary and positive peers along the way, Jaycie hopes to pay forward the support she has received.Now as a volunteer with the Woodlands division, Jaycie visits family members of the incarcerated to provide support and assistance to help them cope. Help does not come only in terms of food but also education and counselling. Families of the incarcerated are given attention in the form of tutors or people whom they can confide in.When asked how she overcomes difficulties in life, Jaycie added I am not so strong by nature, but my mentor touches my heart. I saw tears in her eyes when I was in a bad shape. She guided me to the right resources when I was facing difficulties in life. SG4SecondChances"

As a Yellow Ribbon Champion, Ms Tan oversees the volunteers and cases within her grassroots division. She strongly believes that the community needs to come forward and actively support families of the incarcerated as they are often afraid of asking for help. \"I'm happy ... even if I help just one family [because seeing] a positive change with the relationship between the ex-offender and their family ... is enough to make me feel like I've done something great,\" said Ms Tan.

It's also great to be able to run through the prison grounds too! He recounted an experience with an ex-offender, sharing that he met an ex offender who is now a motivational speaker and felt that the experiences he shared during his school assembly talk was something that benefited both students and teachers.Zili will be joining the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run on 15th September as Captain America to spread joy to runners along the route.

Farisha is constantly looking for opportunities to show her support for second chances. This year, she is proud to be attending the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run 2019, as a social media advocate for the Yellow Ribbon Project.So what kept her going to be a social media advocate for the Yellow Ribbon Project? I've always feel strongly for the Yellow Ribbon Project and particularly for the families of those affected by incarceration. Ultimately, the end goal is to remove any stigma that may still revolve around them and to instill a sense of acceptance among society for these ex-offenders who are only trying their best for themselves and their families. Acceptance from the community for ex-offenders will pave the way for them to better reintegrate into society and prevent them from going back to their old ways. More often than not, the first step comes from people like you and me, why not hear an ex-offender out the next time you see them on the street? You may or may not make a new friend, if not you would have at least lent them a listening ear.Last but not least, we asked Farisha about her favourite running quote and she added: \"It's all in the mind. If you believe you can do it, nothing can stop you!\" Challengeyrself"

So what we believe in is to build a village around each ex-offender to follow them and to journey with them.\" In-care services includes Christian counselling, while aftercare services includes having PFS volunteers guide the inmate upon their release from prisons, as well as assisting them in finding a suitable church community.

We teach our kids to not discriminate, so be it whether its race, economic status, or whether you have past records. Thats what we are trying to inculcate even at Wingstop itself. After they pass the work trial, they are just like a regular full-timer. The only difference is they have a job coach to guide them along the way. Other than that, they are no different than any other regular employee and are treated equally. It all boils down to the performance and their attitude towards the job. Mr Chia shared that with the six-month pilot Career Trial (CT) programme, employers will get an avenue to access the ex-offenders suitability for the job before offering them a permanent employment.Ex-offenders are also offered on the Job Training (OJT) to ensure that they have the correct skillset for their job. This programme helps to strengthen employment outcomes through a short-term work stint with employers, and help ex-offenders navigate challenges after a long period of displacement from work.Once the employability of an ex-offender is enhanced, they will have an easier time reintegrating into society.

        "caption": "[Love And Second Chances] When Alvin Chiong was 15, he worked as a plumber to earn some pocket money. While repairing broken pipes and fixing clogged toilets, a girl named Mei caught his eye, however he was too shy to approach her. He spent the next few months calling 50 different telephone numbers written across his trousers to look for Mei, which he eventually found after much difficulty, and started courting her. After 10 years of dating, they got married in 1997.However things soured in 2007 when Mei caught him red-handed consuming drugs at home. That was when she decided to take their sons and leave him for good. In 2008, with the intention of starting anew, he checked himself into a halfway house. It was only during his third stint in that halfway house that he turned over a new leaf. During the three years at the halfway house, he found religion, companionship and eventually went on to become an employee at the halfway house. By 2014, he felt empowered enough to leave the halfway house and devoted his Saturdays with Mei and his boys. His Sundays were reserved for church and volunteering with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, where Alvin conducts faith-based counselling programmes in prison.As time went on, Alvin and Mei realized that their feelings for each other had never faded. Alvin proposed to Mei again in 2016, and they remarried within the same year. Here at the Yellow Ribbon Project, we couldn't be happier to celebrate stories of SecondChances. Congratulations to Alvin and Mei and thank you for sharing your love story with us! SG4SecondChances valentinesday2019"

However, this did not deter him from completing his education through the Yellow Ribbon Star Bursary and landing himself a marketing role in a law firm. Making it a point to thank everyone who helped him, Jadyn paid it forward by volunteering for the Yellow Ribbon Community Project and helping those who were in a similar position.

A personalised letter written by the incarcerated parent will also be included in the pack to provide encouragement and to foster stronger parent-child bonds. The school bags are sponsored by the Yellow Ribbon Fund.Guest-of-Honour Mr Amrin Amin, Senior Parliamentary Secretary at the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Health, unveiled the new initiative and together with Mrs Josephine Teo , 2nd Minister for Home Affairs and Advisor to Bishan North Grassroots Organisations, distributed the packs to beneficiaries present at the event. Following the launch, grassroots volunteers will begin distributing these packs to families of the offenders in their respective constituencies. This initiative will act as an added touchpoint for YRCP volunteers to engage and connect with the children, alleviate the financial burden on the family and prepare the children for the new school year.

They (inmates) come in for the programme, and most of the time, they leave as proficient artists which really boosts their confidence in life.\" When asked about the theme for this year's exhibition, he shared how it helped to frame them (inmates) in an open manner - a father, husband and/or brother. The team involved the participants and asked them questions like \"what are you interested in pursuing\" and \"what do you want to address this year\", of which, the keywords were then condensed into the theme.In keeping with the theme, a new programme, Art History was included to help participants understand the types of art they were creating.

But all his worries were lifted when he was selected for the Development and Reintegration Programme (DRP). The programme, run jointly by the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) and the Association of Muslim Professionals (AMP), provides support for Malay-Muslim offenders and their families, from the in-care stage when the offender is first incarcerated, to a period of up to 12 months after the offenders release. In-care support includes offenders undergoing the Personal Development Programme, a 10-session programme focusing on the socio-educational development of Malay-Muslim offenders, with a religious element. After-care support includes providing casework services to the family of these offenders, with the intent of enabling their families to become self-reliant.While he was incarcerated, one of Ahmad's constant worries was his children. To facilitate his reintegration, case worker from AMP enrolled his children into student care and then collaborated with Social Service Office and SPS to ensure he had employment upon release. They also facilitated financial assistance for his parents and arranged for religious classes for him to attend when he came out. By leveraging on various agencies to come together and provide holistic support, this enables Ahmad to focus on his rehabilitation and reintegration journey upon his release. \"I am thankful to be in this programme as they rendered support so that the needs of my family are taken care of,\" Ahmad said. Through the assistance given by the DRP, Ahmad was then able to find his footing and turn his life around. He is now better able to cope and ensure that the needs of his children are met.

He also regarded that while the Singapore Prison Service is committed to the rehabilitation of offenders under their custody, community involvement is critical in supporting the families who are affected by the incarceration of a loved one. Minister Shanmugam also announced the launch of a new YRCP initiative, where approximately 900 booster packs will be distributed to the families of offenders to provide further support, as well as to create an additional touchpoint to strengthen bonds between these families and grassroots volunteers.

During 2016, she took up running as a form of therapy to clear her mind when shes stressed.She emphasises the importance of having a running support group as everyone can be a pillar of support to each other and they are able to conquer new races together as a team. Running has also been a sports for her to bond with the people around her as she gets her family members and her friends to join her in races. Jasmine also shared her running tips for first time participants of the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run. Dont think about how long it would take you to complete the run. Just enjoy running with the people around you. Dont forget to warm up and cool down after the race. On why ex-offenders deserve a second chance, Jasmine shared that Everyone deserves a second chance. We should not be condemned just because we made a mistake. We must provide support for one another to re start a new journey! This will be her first time taking part in the Yellow Ribbon Prison Run so do say Hi if you manage to run past her on 9th September 2018. SG4SecondChances 10YRsAndRunning"

For Jack, this was his third time as a judge and what impressed him was the commitment of the participants in putting their heart and soul into the songs. Describing the competition as getting tougher and tougher every year, he describes happily that every year, the inmates bring more passion into their music. Rai spent his third year as the lead mentor getting every participant up to speed. Working closely with the participants, he guided them to better their compositions without losing the essence. When asked to share words of encouragement to aspiring musicians, both chimed: \"Keep practising, keep writing. Like chefs and soccer players, writing songs means putting it into practice and penning your thoughts down.\" Thank you to Jack, Rai, and everyone at COMPASS, for believing in second chances and for inspiring inmates to believe in themselves.

Grace Wong and Lau Leng Hoe (affectionately called Auntie Leng), co-founded ic HUB a secular shelter for homeless female ex-offenders and women in recovery from addictions back in 2013. Since then, the shelter has helped over 100 women get back on their feet and successfully reintegrate back into society. The women are given social support, assistance in job placement and help with finding permanent housing arrangements. While the women wait for job placements, Auntie Leng teaches them how to bake and shares her special recipe for melt-in-the-mouth pineapple tarts and cookies so that the women are given the chance to earn an income and start their lives anew.. Some months are more challenging than others and Grace does not bring home a salary sometimes. Sometimes I ask myself what am I doing and whether it is all worth it, she says ruefully. However, she sees this as a calling to change how ex-offenders are viewed, especially female ex-offenders who have to overcome obstacles like bringing up children single-handedly.. When asked how the community can better help female ex-offenders, she simply says, I think we should have more compassion and dont be quick to judge others. If you would like to show your support, you can order Auntie Lengs cookies via our link on Facebook!. SG4SecondChances"

When asked how he had started consuming drugs, John mentioned that it was a form of escapism from the side effects of his nose cancer treatment.. Johns journey started when he was placed on electronic home tagging and had strict curfew hours to abide by. The strict hours helped him gain discipline. At work, he never felt shunned: Everyone treats me normally, to them, I am not an offender, he recalled of his colleagues.. He also received assistance from SCORE through job coaching and a counsellor who taught him how to strengthen family ties. To date, John has completed his Certificate in Maritime Business, is now pursuing a Diploma and applying for the Yellow Ribbon Star Bursary.. Congratulations John, and we wish you all the best! .

Do not get caught up in the hype and adrenaline and dash out from the start line.2. Do not try anything new, too, on race day. Do not wear new shoes for the first time on race day, as this will increase your chance of getting blisters.3. Hydrate yourself well! There will be enough water points on race day. Make use of them and drink at each water station.4. Grab a pre-workout snack two to three hours before the run and youre good to go!5. Lastly, put on your earpiece for some energetic songs to keep you going for the run."

This event lets the children know that they are not forgotten by the community, said Mrs Wong Ai Ai, Chairman of the YRF.The Yellow Brick Road Programme was developed in 2014 with the aim of reducing the detrimental effects of incarceration and burden on families and children of inmates. In July this year, the Yellow Brick Road Programme was enhanced with a focus on building the future of offenders children with one-to-one home-based tuition and developing hidden potential and talents through social enrichment workshops. Wishing everyone (yes, even the inner child) a Happy Childrens Day from all of us at the Yellow Ribbon Project!"

Eighty one pieces of artwork by inmates and former offenders were on display, symbolising the emotional journey that inmates undergo when incarcerated.SAM provides a platform for inmates to showcase their artworks and publicly express their artistic passions. During previous editions, the curator selected pieces for display after the inmates have completed it. This year, the curator worked alongside with the inmates and the project manager to develop the inspiration behind their artwork. Working closely with the night festival, the theme illustrates their journey behind bars and actually came from the inmates. As this is not something that is dictated to them, they felt a sense of ownership, Andrea Fam, Assistant Curator at SAM.Proceeds from the adoption of artworks will go towards the Yellow Ribbon Fund, which supports a variety of rehabilitation and reintegration programmes as well as family support programmes.

With the support from both the Yellow Ribbon Fund STAR Bursary and allowance provided by Royal Plaza on Scotts, Mr Shaharuddin simultaneously undertook a Diploma in Culinary Skills from SHATEC. He has since been promoted to a 1st Cook as a result of his good work ethic and desire to learn. My ex-wife was asking for divorce at that time, that really made me change. All this while I promised my ex-wife, my kids, my mum and dad, and every one that I would change, but in the end I didnt. So now I needed to change for myself, before I can prove it to them that I can change. Mr Shaharuddin now acts as a mentor to other ex-offenders in the company, and is also a Peer Leader with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association (SANA), sharing his past experiences to help ex-offenders in their reintegration journeys. [Working with Shaharuddin] gave us the confidence that changes are really possible and theres a good source of manpower that we can really look at, says Ms Ong Pau Hsing Juliana, Director of Human Resources at Royal Plaza on Scotts. Ex-offenders need the support of employers and the community in order to successfully reintegrate into society.

If you havent heard of the story before, read it here. Its truly inspiring. ...One day, a man was walking along the beach, when he noticed a boy hurriedly picking up and gently throwing things into the ocean.Approaching the boy, he asked, Young man, what are you doing? The boy replied, Throwing starfish back into the ocean. The sea is up and the tide is out. If I dont throw them back, they will die. The man laughed to himself and said, Havent you realized that there are kilometres and kilometres of beach with hundreds of starfish stranded? You cant make a difference! After listening politely, the boy bent down, picked up another starfish, and threw it into the sea. Then smiling at the man, he said, I made a difference to that one. YRSecondChance"

        "caption": "The Singapore Corporation of Rehabilitative Enterprises (SCORE) Appreciation Awards Ceremony is an annual event organised to recognise the invaluable contributions of various partners who have supported SCORE in the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders. We sat down with Ms Juliana Binti Abdul Khalik, SCOREs Director of Reintegration, to learn more about their initiatives. Ms Juliana shared how SCORE is dedicated to enhancing the employability of ex-offenders, as employment is a key factor in their successful reintegration into society. Other than being given opportunities to participate in work programmes during incarceration, SCORE helps prepare ex-offenders for work by ensuring that training provided is relevant so that employers will have greater confidence when hiring. The trainings are also aligned with the WDAs Workforce Skills Qualification Framework, ensuring offenders attend the same type of training as other Singaporean job seekers. Deepening the commitment to the rehabilitation and reintegration of ex-offenders, SCORE will be extending its job retention support to 12 months for ex-offenders this year. A differentiated approach will also be adopted to assist ex-offenders with differing levels of job fit and commitment. With the new approach, this will increase employers confidence in partnering SCORE to offer employment opportunities, added Ms Juliana. Together with the communitys support and ex-offenders determination, lets keep striving towards successful reintegration for these ex-offenders.SecondChancesEveryday"

        "caption": "Here at the Yellow Ribbon Project, it warms our hearts to see success stories of reformation and reintegration amongst ex-offenders. Speaking to Mr. William Toh Chor Kok confirmed our belief that love goes a long way in changing lives. During his teenage years, Mr. Toh found himself in bad company, when he dabbled with drugs and became an addict soon after. He was apprehended by the police at the early age of 20 and found that the cycle of re-offending was immensely tough for him to break out of. As a result, he spent a total of 13 years in and out of drug rehabilitation centers.The turning point for him was when he saw the enduring love of his family, leading to him questioning his identity and future. Daunting thoughts on whether he would be known as a mere drug addict all his life and whether or not the cycle of re-offending would ever end caused him to realise that he needed to set his priorities straight and pick up important values such as discipline and abstinence, so that he could better continue on his journey of reformation.His journey of change was tough as it required him to make consistent and conscious decisions to do things that would help steer him on his journey of change. As a result of his determination, he was able to stand strong against the influences and become the person that he longed to become.Today, Mr. Toh spreads his love by volunteering with the Prison Fellowship Singapore, sharing with inmates how he had overcome his personal demons with the hope that they would be able to break out of the re-offending cycle too. During these sessions, he emphasises the need to believe and to hang on to love, as well as the importance for everyone to give their own self a second chance.SpreadYRLoveSecondChancesEveryday"

He was also a strong believer that every ex-offender deserves a second chance to fulfil their dreams and ambitions after serving their time. In this spirit, the Association of Muslim Lawyers launched the Yellow Ribbon Subhas Anandan Star Bursary Award in October 2014 as a tribute to the honourable work that Mr Subhas has accomplished. The bursary will provide financial support to ex-offenders who wish to further their studies and pave the way to a fresh start in life. Thank you for championing second chances, Mr Subhas Anandan, you will be greatly missed."
