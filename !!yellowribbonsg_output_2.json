        "caption": "\"A son still sees his father as his hero. A daughter still sees her father as her first love.\" For Bramsha Osman, the heart of his volunteer journey began long before he stepped forward as a prison volunteer. Raised by grandparents who cared deeply for children in their community, he grew up witnessing the power of love, stability and guidance. That early grounding shaped his belief that every child deserves a father who shows up, both emotionally and spiritually.As he continued volunteering, he saw one heartbreaking pattern emerge repeatedly: fatherlessness. It was this realisation that led him to the Centre for Fathering and eventually to the Singapore Prison Service, where he now supports incarcerated fathers through workshops, open visits and reunification activities. Seeing their fears, hopes and determination to reconnect with their children motivates him to keep showing up week after week.Bramsha's volunteerism allows him to journey alongside fathers from all walks of life, especially those who are currently incarcerated or have been released. He holds the firm belief that when a father chooses to grow, reflect, and reconnect, it changes not just his life but his child's future too, and that is why he serves.

        "caption": "\"Stop judging, stop labelling. Listen with the heart.\" At 60-years-old, Jileen Tan embraced a long-held desire to become a prison volunteer, inspired by the profound compassion of Sister Gerard Fernandez years ago, and she continues to be a consistent presence for women inmates in Institution A4. Her weekly visits, which include communion services and counselling, are centred on one simple, powerful act: showing up. As one inmate told her, \" During our sentence, the only thing that we still have is time.\" Jileen's goal is to ensure that time is passed meaningfully, letting them know they are supported.Through her work, Jileen has seen how stigma can affect a person's life in very real ways. \"They are like any of us any one of us could be in there too. It is just that we had a different environment, circumstance, and made different choices.\"Volunteering has taught her to look beyond the surface, connect with empathy, and give hope to those who need it most.

At 16, he was caught in fights and gang riots that landed him in maximum security. By 19, he had no qualifications and no stable home. Instead of giving up, he worked odd jobs, studied part-time, and slowly built a career in technical MEP, AV, IT, and construction project management.Today, he serves as a subject matter expert leading his department, while also giving back to the community through volunteering at Meet-the-People Sessions and mentoring others who are rebuilding their lives.
