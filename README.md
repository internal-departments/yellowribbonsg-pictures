This is just a repo used to store images to be retrieved if you want to send the urls to an external api or something.  
If you know how to use github, you can just move on and use it as needed.  
Otherwise here are some instructions on how to use it.  

### Usage
if you want the images for local use, git clone this repo to local.
```
https://github.com/internal-departments/ica-singapore-pictures.git
```
Otherwise if you want to just reference the images, just use this url
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/internal-departments/{repo_name}-pictures/master/{filename}
```
