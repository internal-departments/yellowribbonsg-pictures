Having been in-and-out of prisons six times, he shared that he was first incarcerated in 1998 for drug-related offences. Distracted by the lure of drugs, he re-offended even after his first release. 23 years later, with unwavering support from his family, he is set on quitting his old ways. He shares that he is grateful to be emplaced at the Jamiyah Halfway House and hopes it would signal a new beginning for him. The staff here are very understanding. We can approach them for help with our issues, like renewing our SingPass. Even the head there is like a father figure to him. He is really looking forward to his overnight home leave on Hari Raya, so he can be at home spending time with his family again.

While repairing broken pipes and fixing clogged toilets, a girl named Mei caught his eye, however he was too shy to approach her. He spent the next few months calling 50 different telephone numbers written across his trousers to look for Mei, which he eventually found after much difficulty, and started courting her. After 10 years of dating, they got married in 1997.However things soured in 2007 when Mei caught him red-handed consuming drugs at home. That was when she decided to take their sons and leave him for good. In 2008, with the intention of starting anew, he checked himself into a halfway house. It was only during his third stint in that halfway house that he turned over a new leaf. During the three years at the halfway house, he found religion, companionship and eventually went on to become an employee at the halfway house. By 2014, he felt empowered enough to leave the halfway house and devoted his Saturdays with Mei and his boys. His Sundays were reserved for church and volunteering with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, where Alvin conducts faith-based counselling programmes in prison.As time went on, Alvin and Mei realized that their feelings for each other had never faded. Alvin proposed to Mei again in 2016, and they remarried within the same year. Here at the Yellow Ribbon Project, we couldn't be happier to celebrate stories of SecondChances.

While repairing broken pipes and fixing clogged toilets, a girl caught his eye, however he was too shy to approach her. He spent the next few months calling 50 different telephone numbers written across his trousers to look for her, which he eventually found after much difficulty, and started courting her. After 10 years of dating, they got married in 1997. However, things soured in 2007 when she caught him red-handed consuming drugs at home. That was when she decided to take their sons and leave him for good. In 2008, with the intention of starting anew, he checked himself into a halfway house. It was only during his third stint in that halfway house that he turned over a new leaf. During the three years at the halfway house, he found religion, companionship and eventually went on to become an employee at the halfway house. By 2014, he felt empowered enough to leave the halfway house and devoted his Saturdays with his family. His Sundays were reserved for church and volunteering with the Singapore Anti-Narcotics Association, where he conducts faith-based counselling programmes in prison. As time went on, they realized that their feelings for each other had never faded. He proposed again in 2016, and they remarried within the same year. Here at the Yellow Ribbon Project, we couldn't be happier to celebrate stories of Second Chances. Congratulations to the couple and thank you for sharing your love story with us!

The event was graced by Guest-of-Honour Mr K Shanmugam, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Law.In his speech, Minister Shanmugam noted that of the 9000 offenders entering into prison, more than 80% have drug antecedents. He also regarded that while the Singapore Prison Service is committed to the rehabilitation of offenders under their custody, community involvement is critical in supporting the families who are affected by the incarceration of a loved one. Minister Shanmugam also announced the launch of a new YRCP initiative, where approximately 900 booster packs will be distributed to the families of offenders to provide further support, as well as to create an additional touchpoint to strengthen bonds between these families and grassroots volunteers. Kudos to the grassroots volunteers for the work that they do it is small acts of kindness that transform the world. SG4SecondChances",
